            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y endeavour (in this little Treatiſe) is to manifeſt to thee both by Scripture and Reaſon, the full, free, univerſall, and individuall Love of God to Mankinde, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Sonne to death for then,
<pb facs="tcp:119925:3"/>that they might live; and in affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abundant meanes to diſcover himſelf full of Love, Grace, and Goodneſſe to them: And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding many Bookes have beene written, wherein this Love of God hath been evidently manifeſted, yet doth this truth ſtill finde many enemies and oppoſers, even of ſuch as have a zeale of God, (but not according to knowledge:) and the ground of this their errour I finde to be a miſ-underſtanding of certaine places of Scripture, which ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict this Doctrine; which Scriptures have not beene anſwered in any Booke that I have ſeene writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on this ſubject of Gods Love.
<pb facs="tcp:119925:3"/>Therefore according to my abilitie I have not onely proved this Doctrine by the teſtimony of divers plaine places of Scripture, but have alſo cleared thoſe other places which are more difficult, from being confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the oppoſers of the fore mentioned truth, Not that I aſſume any infallibility in the expeſition of thoſe hard places of Scripture, but onely declare my thoughts: And therein I have not onely ſatisfied the Letter, and (I hope) the ſcope and meaning of the places, which the contrary expoſitions have failed to doe, but have alſo done it without any the leaſt derogation from, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to the Excellent Nature,
<pb facs="tcp:119925:4"/>and moſt glorious Attributes of the Almighty God, as his Mercy, Iuſtice, ſincerity, Love, grace and goodneſſe, all which the contrary Expoſitions and Opinions doe directly fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. <hi>For there is an inſeparable unity betweene the Attributes of GOD, which men not conſidering, and ſo going about to advance one without the reſt, deſtroy all. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to advance power without juſtice, goodneſſe, love, and mercy, is not to advance the power of God, but to attribute that to God, which neither is, nor can be in him; And the like may be ſaid of all his Attributes: And as they all are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable in God, ſo doe they inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="tcp:119925:4"/>concurre in all his actions and diſpenſations towards his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I deſire thee for thine owne good ſeriouſly to peruſe this enſuing Treatiſe, without prejudice or partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, too much in uſe in theſe times; for generally men ſee with other mens eyes, and heare with other mens eares, and not their owne; yet wee know that every man must give an account to God for himſelfe; and therefore that every man ſhould try and judge for himſelfe, is neceſſary, equall, and excellent. Wee ſhould not proſtrate and debaſe our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to the judgements and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of others, and thereby ſuffer
<pb facs="tcp:119925:5"/>them to bee adulterate and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Wee ſhould preſerve in our ſelves a naturall freedome and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of ſpirit in this reſpect, like the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> unto whom though Paul preached a new Doctrine, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine every where ſpoken againſt and perſecuted, yet did they with all readineſſe of minde receive it, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things were ſo as Paul had told them.</p>
            <p>If wee receive or beleeve any thing, becauſe it is in authority, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, or practice, in the countrey, or place where we were borne or bred; or reject any thing from the contrary
<pb facs="tcp:119925:5"/>reaſon, it matters not what wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve or what we reject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doe any of the Rulers beleeve in him,</hi> was the old and corrupt Plea of the proud and hypocriticall Phariſes, who would neither receive the truth themſelves, nor ſuffer others; they would ſeeke and receive honour one from another, and reject that truth which had the teſtimony and honour of God alone.</p>
            <p>The world was never unfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of men poſſeſt with this Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſpirit; that having concluded certaine Principles and preſcript Formes, would ſubject; all other
<pb facs="tcp:119925:6"/>mens judgements, conſciences, and practices thereunto, upon the greateſt penalties, without further triall or examination, it being ever a marke and politicke practice of falſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo to doe: for they know that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due tryall their Doctrines would bee found vaine and groundleſſe; therefore tryall is to them as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death. Whereas it is proper, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and Chriſtian-like for us to weigh, try, and examine all things, all the reaſons for and againſt, with freedome and ingenuity of ſpirit; and hold faſt that onely which is good; and nothing is good to us but what wee finde good upon tryall.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay try all things, and
<pb facs="tcp:119925:6"/>ſo try what is here written, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace or reject it as thou ſhalt finde it conſonant or diſſonant to truth; which is the deſire of him that deſires thy increaſe in the truth, and thy good in all things,</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat God is infinite in Love, in Goodneſſe, and in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the Scriptures plainely declare, the daily diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God towards his Creatures manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, and all Men confeſſe; but if the love of God be limited to a few, it is far
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119925:8"/>from being Infinite: he that doth good, or ſhewes mercy to one in miſery, and paſſeth by another in the like condition in every reſpect, the defect muſt be in his heart, or in his ability; now we know that it is not for want of ability of God ſhew not mercy to all, and to aſcribe it to his heart, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, will, or pleaſure, is to blaſpheme his excellent name and nature: for what God is in his attributes, or what wee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to bee inſeparable from his nature, as Juſtice, mercy, love, ſincerity, faithfullnes, and goodneſſe; he muſt be to all he that is love it ſelfe, goodneſſe it ſelfe, muſt needs be loving and good to all: So that it is not ſuitable to God to pick and chuſe amongſt men in ſhewing mercy, for he may as well ceaſe to be, as to withhold mercy from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one in miſery, ſo farre as it is conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his other attributes; this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall love of God is that which I intend to Write of, which I ſhall manifeſt by proving theſe two particulars: Firſt, that God gave his Sonne to death, that all through him might have life. And ſecondly, that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords all men ſufficient meanes to diſcover himſelf good and gracious to them, thereby
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119925:8"/>to beget goodneſſe and grace in them: And firſt I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe; That the love of God, manifeſted in giving his onely begotten Son to death, was to the whole lump of mankind, and this appeareth by what is written, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoever beleeved in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> God ſo loved the World, that is, all mankind, that hee gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever [of them] beleeved in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh but live eternally.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Obj. By World is meant the World of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, that the Elect in their owne ſenſe ſhall all believe, but this word <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> intimateth that many of this world here meant may not beleeve, for if by World here you will underſtand the Elect onely, then this will bee the ſenſe of the words, <hi>God ſo loved the world of the Elect, that whoſoever of this world of the Elect beleeves in him, ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Obj. <hi>By World is meant the whole lumpe of mankind, but thoſe that are not elect can never beleeve, for God will never give them faith, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119925:9"/>therefore though God doth thus proclaime his love to all, yet ſeeing it is impoſſible that any other then the elect ſhould beleeve, this Text doth not hinder, but that the death of Chriſt may ſtill bee limited to the elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then the love of God to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the world may bee thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>ſuch and ſo great is the love of God towards you, that when you doe that which is impoſſible for you ever to performe,</hi> viz. <hi>believe, then you ſhall obtaine that from him, which he cannot in juſtice beſtow upon you,</hi> viz. <hi>remiſſion of ſins and eternall life.</hi> And that I may illuſtrate the abſurdity of this Objection, conſider what is written in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 25, 26. whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſſe for the remiſsion of ſinnes that are paſt, through the forbearance of God, to declare I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſſe, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of thoſe that believe in Jeſus; in which words, we may perceive that <hi>God</hi> doth proceed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in ſuch a way, as hee may declare his righteouſneſſe in juſtifying of ſinners; and moreover that that God could not bee juſt, and the juſtifier of the ungodly, but through
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119925:9"/>the death of his Sonne, for without blood there is no remiſsion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. Now if God hath ſo loved the world, that he hath given his Sonne, that whoſoever believes in him ſhould not periſh but have eternall life, then the Son muſt die for all, otherwiſe if thoſe hee did not dye for ſhould believe an hundred times, yet muſt they die in their ſinnes, yea they are as farre from Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as ever they were, and ſo this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth contradict the word of God, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God hath ſo loved men, or ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Chriſt that all men may have life through ſaith; for God is able no more, nor no further to extend the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of life, peace, and remiſsion of ſinnes, then the death of Chriſt (which is the ground of the Goſpell) doth extend; <hi>For he may as well pardon and remit the ſins of all Men, without relation to the blood and Sacrifice of his Son, as he way preach and proffer remiſſion of ſins, or eternall life to all or any man, for whom Chriſt did not ſhed his blood;</hi> but as God will not do that which is unjuſt, ſo neither will he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to doe it, for in him juſtice, and mercy are inſeperable, that is, he is mercifull, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and juſt mercy, therefore his mercy in

            <p>Another Text for this purpoſe is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſaith For I delivered unto you firſt of all that which I alſo received, how that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, according to the Scriptures: In which words conſider, firſt what it was that he delivered to theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that is, <hi>that Chriſt dyed for their ſins,</hi> And ſecondly, when he delivered this unto them, and that was firſt of all; Now if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not died for all, <hi>Paul</hi> could not have concluded that Chriſt had dyed for them, for they were at that time Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles carried away with dumb Idolls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:119925:10"/>12.2. Fornicators, Adulterers, Theeves, Drunkards, and the like, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.10.11. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake not from any ſpeciall Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God concerning theſe men in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but he ſpake according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which foretold the death of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if it be objected, <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>doth not ſay, for your ſins, but for our ſins, joining himſelf with the reſt who were believers at that time, or with the Elect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, that this could be no glad tydings to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that Chriſt dyed for <hi>Paul</hi> and others, if they were not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; if <hi>Paul</hi> were not able to prove by the Scriptures, that Chriſt dyed for them whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they were ſinners, then they could not receive it, nor ſtand in it, nor be ſaved by it, as the former verſes expreſſe, for faith comes by hearing, &amp; hearing by the Word of <hi>God;</hi> for wee cannot believe that of which wee have not heard. Againe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. It is ſaid, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead: <hi>Paul</hi> with the reſt that ſent that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, having in the former Verſes ſpoken of being beſides themſelves towards God, and ſober for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> cauſe, tells
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119925:11"/>them that the love of Chriſt did conſtrain them, and why ſo, becauſe they did judge that they were dead; and how do they prove that they were dead, they tell them that all were dead, and therefore they were dead; and that all were dead appeares in that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all, and this I conceive to be the meaning of theſe words: If one dyed for all, then were all dead. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. Wee are exhorted to make Prayers and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all men, &amp; the reaſon is declared in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>God</hi> would have all to be ſaved; &amp; that his deſire is that all ſhould be ſaved, he hath fully manifeſted in giving Chriſt a ranſome for all, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. Now it is not the will of God that any ſhould be ſaved, for whom Chriſt did not die, and our Praiers muſt be made according to the will of God, therefore if Chriſt dyed not for all, we cannot pray in faith for any, much leſſe for all.</p>
            <p>If we have a ground in the Scriptures to pray for the Salvation of all men, then if we do pray in faith for all, or any man, they or he ſo prayed for, ſhall certainely bee ſaved.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that God hath not in the Scriptures declared abſolutely or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119925:11"/>that he will ſave all men, but he hath declared, and that truly and ſincerely, that he would have all men to be ſaved; he ſpeaks in the Optative Mood, he wills it, he deſires it: And in this alſo we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that God ſpeaks after the manner of men: now what men deſire they uſe means to accompliſh, ſo God wills and deſires the ſalvation of men, (that is) hee puts forth himſelf in waies &amp; means, to accompliſh it, and ſuitable to this muſt our Prayers for men be, that God would be pleaſed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Goſpel of grace to them, which is able to ſave their ſouls, that hee would bring them (that is) that hee would uſe means to bring them from darknes to light from the power of <hi>Satan</hi> unto himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.37, 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Wee muſt pray for all, (that is) for all ſorts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we are to pray for all ſorts, and not for all of all ſorts, then (I ſay) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray for one of any ſort, for that perſon whatſoever he be (if any bee excepted may be the man for whom wee ought not to pray, <hi>ſo this principle doth ſtate a man in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibility of fullfilling the mind of Chriſt,</hi> for he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119925:12"/>would have us pray for all, and wee muſt pray in faith, or we were better to hold our peace, for we ſhall never obtaine any thing of God; we muſt not doubt <hi>Iames</hi> 1. now if God leaves the thing dubitable and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, concerning perſons in unbeliefe, whom he would have ſaved, and who not, then I muſt be in doubt alſo, unleſſe I will be wiſeabove that which is written: and ſo I can pray for the ſalvation of no man whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Againe, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>My little children, theſe things I write unto you, that you ſin not; but if any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous: and hee is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> The words are plaine, onely be pleaſed to conſider, that this Epiſtle was written in generall to all beleevers, ſuch as had attained to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth; and he tells them, that Chriſt is a propitiation for their ſins, and not for theirs onely, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world. The ſpirit of God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that men would endevour to hide themſelves under the miſts and clouds of vaine interpretations, labours to anticipate
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119925:12"/>them by ſuch full and evident expreſsions, as may no way be avoided with any ſhew or colour of ground, and therefore he puts in, the <hi>whole world,</hi> the <hi>world</hi> in an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and individuall conſideration; ſo that no man can without offering great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and injury to the Text, put any other interpretation upon it.</p>
            <p>Again, in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.10.11.12. it is ſaid, <hi>that he that beleeveth on the Son of God, hath the witneſſe in himſelfe: he that beleeveth not God, hath made him a lyar, becauſe he beleeveth not the record that God gave of his Son: and this is the record that God hath given to us eternall life, and this life is in his Son; he that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> Here we ſee that the Apoſtle affirmes, that the unbeleever makes God a lyar, in not beleeving that God hath given him eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If God hath given him eternall life, he ſhall certainly live, and not come into condemnation.</p>
            <p>The anſwere to this objection is in the latter end of the 11. and 12 verſes, in theſe words, <hi>And this life is in his Son</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould have ſaid, he that beleeves not,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119925:13"/>makes God a lyar, in not beleeving that God hath given his Sonne as a meanes of eternall life to all men, or in not beleeving that God hath given him eternall life in his Son: All that God requires of us is, to receive the Son in whom this life is; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the record of God, that he hath given us eternall life in him: and he that receives the Son, receives life; and he that receives him not, <hi>the wrath of God abides on him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he receives him not, Ioh.</hi> 3.36.</p>
            <p>Againe, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4 8.9. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love: In this was manifeſted the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, becauſe that God ſent his onely begotten Son into the world, that wee might live through him.</hi> Here are three things conſiderable in this Text; firſt, the deſcription of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, in theſe words, <hi>God is love:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the manifeſtation thereof, <hi>he ſent his onely begotten Son into the world, that wee might live through him:</hi> and laſtly, a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ground and reaſon of the want of love, in thoſe perſons that love not God, they know him not who is love, and hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the ſame in <hi>ſending his Sonne into the world, that they might live through him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:119925:13"/>
            <p>If it be objected, That the Apoſtle wrote this to beleevers, and therefore when hee ſaith, <hi>he ſent his onely begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him,</hi> hee therein hath relation onely to ſuch.</p>
            <p>I anſwere, that the Apoſtle wrote this to Beleevers is true, but when he ſaith, <hi>hee that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love,</hi> he hath relation to unbeleevers, and intimateth ſuch perſons as are ignorant of God and of his love towards them, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Goſpel. And if theſe words, <hi>(God ſent his Son into the World that we might live through him)</hi> ſhould onely reſpect belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, then would there bee no argument therein to convince thoſe perſons that doe not love God, as is intended: for of what force would it be with any man that doth not love God, or reaſon to perſwade him thereunto, or to convince him of ſinne in not loving, to tell him that God is love, and hath manifeſted the ſame in ſending his Son into the world, that other men (but not that he) might live through him? wherefore we muſt underſtand the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this place, as if he ſhould have ſaid thus, There be many perſons in the World
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119925:14"/>that love not God, but if they did but know and conſider what he is, and what love he hath manifeſted towards them, in ſending his onely begotten Sonne into the World, that they (through him) might have life, it would bee a ſtrong motive and perſwaſion with them to love him.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe of Chriſts dying for all, you may further conſider theſe Scriptures: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. where wicked men which periſh are charged with denying the Lord that bought them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. where it is ſaid that Chriſt taſted death for every man. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.48. where Chriſt is ſaid to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to ſave the word. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.51. where it is ſaid, that he gave his fleſh for the life of the world. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14. where he is termed the Saviour of the world. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.29. where he is called, the Lambe of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the word: and divers other places there are to the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>Further, conſider theſe reaſons or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: God hath commanded that the Goſpel be preached to all men, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Goe preach the goſpell</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature:</hi> and the Goſpel is <hi>glad
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119925:14"/>tidings of good things, Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>viz.</hi> remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. Salvation <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. and everlaſting life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.40. Now if the glad tidings (which are to be preached to every creature) be the Goſpel, in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which we have life, and for refuſing of which we periſh, then Chriſt muſt dye for all, for there is no reconciliation without a propitiation; without blood no remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without death no life for ſinfull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for God hath no peace nor remiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for that man, for whom Chriſt did not dye: and God would not proffer (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence be it ſpoken) more then he hath to beſtow: Therefore ſeeing the goſpel is to be preached to all, God hath ſtrengthened himſelfe in Chriſt accordingly, in giving him for all.</p>
            <p>Againe, if God command the goſpel to be preached to all, and Chriſt dyed onely for ſome (the goſpel being Chriſt crucified for their ſinnes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 3.) then God commands a lie to be preached to the moſt part of men, (which were blaſphemy to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.)</p>
            <p>Againe, if Chriſt dyed not for all, and God doe not diſcover for whom he did
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119925:15"/>die, then the Goſpel <hi>(viz)</hi> Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, canot be preached to any man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Goſpel is to bee preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all, but not to all, nor any in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in unbeliefe; wee muſt tell them Chriſt died for ſinners and no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If Chriſt died for ſinners, and by ſinners wee underſtand onely ſome ſelected ones, then no man hath ground from the Goſpel of grace to believe, that Chriſt died for him, and ſo cannot eſtabliſh his ſoule in the love and grace of God; For Faich comes by hearing, and if the Goſpel ſay no more but Chriſt died for ſome, then all wee can believe is but that Chriſt died for ſome, which may be, and we periſh in our ſinnes; now how ſhall we believe the grace of God in the Goſpel, if the Goſpel give ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine a ſound? for as we cannot believe that of which we have not hear'd, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we believe more of any thing then what we have heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Its further objected, that we may tell them all, that if they believe they ſhall bee ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then I would deſire an anſwer to this one Queſtion, what men are to believe?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119925:15"/>Some ſay that we are to believe that Chriſt died for us, if ſo, then as the blind-man ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.36. <hi>who is hee that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him?</hi> ſo may wee ſay, where hath God ſo ſpoken, that Chriſt hath dyed for us, that we may believe? They tell us that if we believe that he died for us, then he did die for us, <hi>as if faith did beget truth, and not truth beget Faith.</hi> The thing to be beleeved muſt be true, before I believe it: for it is the Goſpel of truth that begets faith in us, and it alwaies begets a faith in its owne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; therefore although Chriſt died for Sinners (if all be not included) there is no ſufficient ground for any man from the word of truth to believe that Chriſt dyed for him, and ſo whereas the Goſpel is to bee Preached to every man, this doctrine will not enable the Miniſters thereof to preach it to any man, for the Goſpel being <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified, extends no further then the Croſſe extends; and when they come to a company of people without faith, to preach Chriſt to them, they know not whether Chriſt dyed for any one of them or not, and therefore are unable to ſay to any one of them, that Chriſt died for their ſinnes;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119925:16"/>and there is no other name given under Heaven whereby men can have life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Doctrine of Chriſts dying onely for ſome, ſhuts up the Goſpel of grace from the World, and ſtops the mouthes of men from declaring the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The Goſpell muſt not be preached to men abſolutely, but with this condition, if they be converted and repent; for before they repent wee muſt preſſe the law upon them, and tell them that the benefit of Chriſt doth not pertaine to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We find in the ſecond of the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi> 1. and 8, that Chriſt in flaming fire will <hi>render vengeance to ſuch as obey not the Goſpell,</hi> and Joh. 3.18. he that believeth not, is ſaid <hi>to be condemned already, and that becauſe he doth not believe in the name of the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne of God;</hi> and ſo when Chriſt gave Commiſsion to Preach the Goſpell to all the World, <hi>Marke.</hi> 16.16. he addes, <hi>he that beleeveth not ſhall bee damned;</hi> now if ſuch men as are never converted, are to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for not believing; then certainely the Goſpell belongs to them, and is a truth in reference to them, before they repent and be converted; and what they are bound
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119925:16"/>to believe, the Miniſters of Chriſt-are bound to declare to them: and beſides, the Goſpell is to convert men, and to turne them from darkenes to light, to teach them to deny ungodlineſſe and worldlines, and therefore is to bee preached to men uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, men in blindneſſe and darknes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if it told men that if they repent, they may and ought to believe that Chriſt dyed for them; it is all one in effect, as if they ſhould be told that they may and ought to believe that Chriſt dyed for them, though they never repent: for what Chriſt did was done before they repented, and their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting makes it never the more to be; and if Chriſt did not die for them when they were unconverted, it were a vaine thing for them to believe in him, though they ſhould repent and be converted.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>If men were able to repent when they would, then we could not preach the Gospell to all men upon this condition (if they repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted) but repentance is the guift of God, and men cannot turne themſelves, therefore wee may tell them, that if they repent and be converted, they may believe that Chriſt dyed for them; ſeeing we we know that God will give Repentance to none
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119925:17"/>but ſuch as</hi> CHIRST <hi>dyed for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then we ſhould ſpeake to the moſt of men to this effect, <hi>doe that which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you ever to performe, to wit Repent, and then you may believe that which is not true, to wit, that Chriſt dyed for your ſinnes;</hi> a very poore incouragement to, or ground of repentance. And for preſsing the Law on men uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, I would faine know how they can preſſe it upon others and exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ſentence of it; for if the Law be alive (conſidered alone without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Chriſt) then all muſt periſh, ſmall ſinners as well as great, ſeeing all are ſinfull and unjuſt; and this preſsing the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, and exhorting penitents only (as penitents) to believe, doth teach men to lay the ground and foundation of their faith in themſelves, and ſo their faith is ſtronger or weaker, as they appeare to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better or worſe men. Muſt be preſſed to repentance, love, and holineſſe, from the love and grace of God towards them as ſinners; they muſt not firſt beleeve becauſe they are good, but they muſt be good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe: <hi>Paul</hi> the chiefe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners obtained mercy, and ſo became a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119925:17"/>of the large extent of the love of <hi>God,</hi> that no man might exclude himſelfe from his grace and mercy in Chriſt; and Chriſt converſed with Publicans and Harlots, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſhew his deſire of the good, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Sinners, and to reprove the error of the Phariſees, that thought that Chriſt ſhould ſave and reſpect ſuch onely as were Phariſaically holy and reformed; whereas Chriſt tells them that (he comming to ſave ſinners) the more ſinfull men were, the more proper it was for him to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to recover, reform, and ſave them by his grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all men are called upon to believe, that they may have life, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. now <hi>God</hi> would not call upon all to believe if there was not a Chriſt cruciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all to believe in.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Unbelievers are threatned with eternall death and ruine for their unbelief, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18.36. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.14.15. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. now if <hi>Chriſt</hi> died not for all thoſe for whom he did not die ſhould rather be threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with condemnation for believing, then for unbeliefe; yea, certainly in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God condemnes them, <hi>he would juſtifie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119925:18"/>them in this, that they did not believe that Chriſt dyed for their ſins,</hi> for to have believed that (if <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not dye for them) had been to believe a lie, then which nothing can bee no more contrary to the God of Truth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, thoſe men which periſh, are chargedwith <hi>neglect of ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 2.3. and <hi>putting from them the word of eternall life,</hi> Acts 13.46. and <hi>for not receiving the truth in the love thereof, that they might be ſaved,</hi> 2 Theſſa. 2.10. and <hi>for not comming to Chriſt that they may have life,</hi> John 5.40. Theſe and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions are uſed, concerning ſuch as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and reject the Gopell; by which it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeares, that there was life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the Goſpell for them; <hi>for they could not put that from them, which was never there for them; Chriſt would not blame them, for not comming to him that they might have Life, if there had been no life in him for them if they had come;</hi> and there is life in him for none for whom hee did not die; the receiving of no truth whatſoever would ſave them, if Chriſt had not ſhed his blood for them; ſeeing <hi>without blood there is no Remiſſion,</hi> therefore it is cleare that Chriſt hath given
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119925:18"/>himſelfe to the death for all, and is become a compleat meanes of life to all.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Chriſt would not pray for the world, much leſſe would hee die for the ſame,</hi> Joh. 17.9.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to this <hi>Objection,</hi> conſider theſe two particulars. Firſt, who they were that Chriſt prayed for. Secondly, what it was that Chriſt prayed for. The perſons for whom Chriſt prayed, were thoſe whom God had given him out of the world, <hi>verſ.</hi> the 6. <hi>ſuch as had received the word of God, and did know and believe that he was ſent of God,</hi> ver. the 8. <hi>ſuch as the world did hate,</hi> verſe the 14. <hi>ſuch as Chriſt ſent out into the world,</hi> verſ. the 18. whereby it appeares, that the perſons prayed for were ſuch as did at that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe, and ſo were given to Chriſt; for the World loved them aſwell as others, whil'ſt they were in unbeliefe, and were of the World: And it further appeares that it were the Diſciples of Chriſt only, which were there ſaid to be given and prayed for, if you conſider the 12. <hi>Verſe, Thoſe that thou haſt given me have I kept, and none of them is loſt but the Son of Perdition;</hi> compared with the 20. Verſ. where it is ſaid, <hi>Neither pray I for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119925:19"/>theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall beleeve on me through their word;</hi> Now Chriſt needs not to inlarge his prayer, for thoſe that ſhould afterwards believe, if they had beene included in the former words, <hi>thoſe which thou haſt given me,</hi> for that would have been a vaine repetition. Secondly, conſider what Chriſt prayed for, <hi>(viz)</hi> that they might be one, and that they might bee kept from the evill of the World; now Chriſt did not deſire nor endeavour to make unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene believers and unbelievers, but the contrary, and there was no need of Chriſts prayer, that Unbelievers (though elect) ſhould be kept from the evill of the World, for the World could not diſcern any thing in the Elect (during their unbelief) which ſhould cauſe them to have an evill eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; and if by evill wee underſtand the corruption of the World, then they were of thoſe that made the times corrupt, and ſo Chriſt would have prayed his Father to have delivered them out of the evill or wickedneſſe of the world, rather then to keepe them from it; and ſo the reaſon is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by what hath been ſaid, why Chriſt excluded the unbelieving World out of his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119925:19"/>prayer, ſeeing he tooke occaſion from the enmity of the world againſt his people, to make this prayer unto his Father, which prayer was in no ſenſe proper for the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving World.</p>
            <p>And moreover, hee excepted the world in no other reſpect, but as they were conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red oppoſing their owne Salvation, not that he would not have all to bee ſaved, but that the World might not prevaile againſt his worke in hand, the divulging of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which was to be done by his Diſciples; (therefore is he ſo earneſt for them, that the evill of the world might not prevaile over them in their Miniſtery in his abſence) that thereby the world might know that he was ſent of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>therefore their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was more implyed in theſe words (I pray not for the World) then their condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj</hi> Many men were in Hell that very time that Chriſt did die, and therefore it is a fooliſh thing to thinke that Chriſt dyed for them.</p>
            <p>Firſt I Anſwer, that no man is yet in Hel, neither ſhall any be there untill the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for <hi>God</hi> doth not hang firſt, and judge after; and therefore wee ſee the Scriptures
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119925:20"/>referreth the puniſhment of men untill the laſt day, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Theſſalouians, ſeeing (ſaith he) it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you that are troubled reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall bee revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and on them that obey not the Gospell of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, when hee ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to bee admired in all them that believe,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. verſ. ſo Matth. 25. <hi>when the Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, and all his holy Angels with him, and ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his glory, then he ſhall pronounce the ſentence of death on the wicked; Goe yee Curſed into everlaſting fire,</hi> &amp;c. And that place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. where <hi>Dives</hi> is ſaid to be in Hell fire, is a Parable, and proves no more that there was any ſuch thing, then that which is written <hi>Iudges</hi> 9. doth prove that the Trees did walke and talke one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or that which is written, 2 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 4. doth prove, that the Trees tooke Councell to war againſt the Sea, to make them more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119925:20"/>woods, or the Floods of the Sea to ſubdue the Woods of the plaine, to make them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country. And beſides, if wee reaſon from that parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> that proved his body alſo to bee in Hell, which all grant to remaine in the grave, untill the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the ſcope and end of a parable is onely to bee Conſidered and Reaſoned from.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be granted that many men were in hell at that very time that Chriſt dyed, yet were it not a fooliſh thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt died for them as ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; for Chriſt was a Lambe ſlaine from the foundation of the world, and all that grace, meanes and mercy which God ever ſince the fall did extend to <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, was in reference to Chriſt, and the death of Chriſt doth declare the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God in all his love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſinfull men that are dead, that hee was juſt, though gracious, loving, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to them.</p>
            <p>And beſides, ſeeing that men doe likewiſe affirme, that there were many righteous in Heaven when Chriſt dyed, as there were many wicked in Hell; they may aſwell
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119925:21"/>affirm it to be a vaine thing to believe that Chriſt dyed for thoſe that were in Heaven before, as for thoſe that were in Hell before, but neither of theſe is true, yet if they were both true, the Objection from thence will vaniſh, if we conſider that the life and death of all men ariſeth from the well uſing or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing that mercy and favour which is afforded them in reference to the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If Chriſt had ſhed his blood for all, ſurely he would have afforded the Goſpel; (he would publiſh this glad tidings) to all, ſeeing, without faith in his blood all men ſhall periſh for whom he died, for hee that believeth not ſhall be damned, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. and there is ſalvation in no other, neither is there any other name under Heaven gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven among men, wherby we muſt be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. and without faith it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of Faith is ſin <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.33.</p>
            <p>Firſt I Anſwer, that Faith in Chriſt is not required of thoſe that never heard of Chriſt: for the juſtice of Gods mercy, requires no man to doe that which is impoſsible for him to performe, for in ſo doing God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119925:21"/>would be a hard maſter, expecting to reape where hee hath not ſowne, and to gather where he hath not ſtrawed; now no Man can believe that of which hee hath not heard, nor never could, if he be conſidered in reference to that perfect ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein hee was made; and if God ſhould condemne men (that never heard of Chriſt) for not keeping the Law, then hee would require moſt, where he hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leaſt, contrary to that which is written, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48. <hi>where much is given, much is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> and to that <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. where God is ſaid <hi>(in the times of ignorance)</hi> to winke at that vanity and ſuperſtition, which (upon the preaching of the Goſpel) he required <hi>all men every where to repent of.</hi> When I ſay men ſhall not be condemned for not keeping the law, my meaning is that they ſhall not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned becauſe they are not perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, juſt and good, as the Law is, for hee that failes in one tittle, is uncapable of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Law, ſo that the Law condems all men, in that all are ſinners; and the Law ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no repentance, if it be conſidered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without reference to Chriſt; yet men are to be judged by the Law, as it is qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119925:22"/>by the love and grace of God in Chriſt; ſo the <hi>Iewes</hi> were to be judged by the Law which was given them of God; and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> by the Law written in their hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. for when God hath (by the meanes which he affords) diſcovered what is good, and what is evill, what is juſt, and what is unjuſt; if men apply themſelves (with ſincerity and uprightneſſe of heart, in love and obedience to <hi>God</hi> and his truth) to that which is holy, juſt, and good, they ſhall ſurely bee accepted, for <hi>God</hi> is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons but in every Nation hee that feareth him and worketh righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhall bee accepted with him; and the mercy of Gods Juſtice, and the Juſtice of Gods mercy in Chriſt to loſt men, requires of them according to what he affords them, and not according to what they have not, although they once had it, and in what hee affords them alſo. If hee were not rich in mercy and ready to pardon, no man would ever be juſtified or ſaved by him: and for that which is written, <hi>Marke</hi> 16.16. if we take notice of what precedes, we may eaſily perceive that theſe words, <hi>hee that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> have reſpect only to ſuch
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119925:22"/>as have the goſpell preached to them; for in the former Verſe hee gives commiſsion to his Diſciples <hi>to goe into all the World, and preach the Goſpell to every Creature,</hi> and then (when the goſpel was plainly and powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared) <hi>hee that Believed and was Baptized ſhould bee ſaved, and hee that believed not ſhould bee damned;</hi> he that believeth not ſhall bee damned, as he that believeth not makes <hi>God</hi> a lyar, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.20. novv hee that never heard of the Goſpell doth not make God a lyer, though hee doe not believe, no more ſhall that man be condemned for unbeliefe, that never heard of the goſpel. And for that which is written, <hi>Acts</hi> the 4.12. <hi>that there is Salvation in non but Chriſt, and that there is no other name under Heaven given amongſt men, whereby they muſt be ſaved;</hi> the Apoſtles were to preach (where ever they came) Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, neither was or is there ſalvation in or by any other name, though men might and may be ſaved by that name that never came to the knowledge of it: for that <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.6. it ſpeakes not of faith in Chriſt, but of faith in God; as the latter part of the <hi>verſ.</hi> doth evidently demonſtrate, the words are theſe, <hi>for hee that commeth to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119925:23"/>God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently ſeek him, ſo that without faith in</hi> God <hi>no man can be ſaved,</hi> for that <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> there concludes, that whatever a man acts or performes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it unlawful, he ſins in what he doth, though the thing be lawfull in it ſelf, (and might be done by a man that had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) as that was which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of in that place: but the place ſpeaks not of faith in Chriſt, onely it would have men to be fully perſwaded in their hearts of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes of what they doe, and likewiſe to refraine things lawfull in themſelves, rather then to be a ſtumbling block to their weak Brother: and ſo much for this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Chriſt dyed for all, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally, he taking the nature of man upon him, his death muſt needs extend to all of that nature in the ſufficiencie of it; but neither <hi>God</hi> in giving Chriſt, nor Chriſt in giving himſelf, ever intended the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his death, remiſsion of ſins and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life to any, but the Elect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt I anſwer by way of conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that God never intended the benefits
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119925:23"/>of Chriſts death to any but the Elect if we take Election according to the Scriptures, for it is the will of the Father that thoſe, and none but thoſe that believe ſhould have eternall life, and believers only are the objects and Subjects of Gods Election: for Election looks not on men in <hi>Adam,</hi> but in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I ſpeak only of ſuch as have the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell plainely and powerfully preached to them: but ſeeing moſt men doe conceive that God doth elect ſome men to life in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and leaves the reſt, we ſhall ſtate the Queſtion thus: Whether God did ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intend that thoſe men which periſh and are damned, ſhould have believed, and ſo have come to life? And to this I anſwer affirmatively, for it was ſhewed before that God commanded all men to believe in his Son that they might be ſaved. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Ioh</hi> 12.36.37. That he threatneth all thoſe which believe not with everlaſting deſtruction <hi>from his preſence, and the glory of his power,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8. <hi>and that becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live not,</hi> Joh. 3.18. <hi>and becauſe they received not the truth in the love thereof, that they might beſaved, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> as 2 Theſ. 2.10.12. <hi>That hee pittieth thoſe that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119925:24"/>periſh through the abuſe of his grace extended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them,</hi> Pſal. 81.8.13. Matth. 23.37. Luke 19.41.42. Therefore it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that he intended the benefits of his death <hi>(viz.)</hi> remiſsion of ſins, and eternall life to thoſe, <hi>who by truſting inlying vanities, for ſake their own mercies,</hi> Jonah 2.8. <hi>and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to perdition,</hi> Heb. 10 39. as well as to thoſe, <hi>who believe to the ſaving of their ſouls,</hi> Heb. 10.39. But yet further conſider theſe Scriptures, Joh. 3.17. <hi>God ſent not his Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> This Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which ſets forth the act of Gods love in ſending his Son into the World, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alſo his end and intention therein ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, not to condemne the World affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, <hi>but that the World through him might be ſaved.</hi> Againe, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.47. <hi>If any man heare my words and believe not, Iudge him not, for I came not into the world to judge the world, but to ſave the World.</hi> Why will not Chriſt judge thoſe men that heare his words and believe not? becauſe he came to ſave them. Againe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.34.40. Chriſt ſpeaking to the obſtinate <hi>Iewes</hi> ſaith unto them, <hi>theſe things ſpeak I unto you,</hi> (for what end) <hi>that yee
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119925:24"/>may be ſaved: And yee will not come to me that yee may have life,</hi> Neither doth Chriſt herein expreſle his owne deſires and intentions of the ſalvation of thoſe obſtinate <hi>Iewes,</hi> but the will and intention of his Father alſo, <hi>For he came not downe from Heaven to doe his owne will, but the will of the Father which ſent him:</hi> therefore it appeares that as the death of Chriſt was extended to all, ſo likewiſe the benefits therof were both by the Father and the Son intended for all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If God ſent his Son, and it be his deſire to ſave all men, and yet all men are not ſaved, then God miſſeth his end and is diſappointed of his deſire, which is very unſuiteable to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If God had ſent his Sonne with an abſolute and peremptory reſolution to ſave all men, whether they did receive him or reject him, then all muſt be ſaved, or God diſappointed, which cannot be, for he doth whatſoever he will, and if he work in this ſence who can hinder? but God in ſending of his Sonne did intend he ſhould be a ſufficient means to ſave all; and ſo to ſave them if they did not reſiſt and diſpiſe this grace of his, which if they did, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119925:25"/>to condemne them, and not to ſave them by his Sonne.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid that God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that any ſhould periſh, and that he deſires the ſalvation of all; I conceive it is thus to be underſtood, <hi>he is not willing that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould periſh for want of ſufficient means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and he deſires the ſalvation of all as they are in a loſt condition, unable to helpe themſelves: but not as they are conſidered malicious contemnen of all grace and ſavour, means and mercies,</hi> for that were to ſet his attributes at variance and divide God in himſelf; the mercy of whoſe juſtice is to afford means of help to that which cannot help it ſelf, and the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of whoſe mercie is to condemne him that refuſeth ſuch helpe, and to ſave him that receiveth it; ſo that his mercie cannot deſire the ſalvation of all, but his juſtice muſt afford the means of accompliſhment; and when his juſtice affordeth means, his mercie is ſaid to deſire, for as what men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, they uſe means to accompliſh, ſo what <hi>God</hi> uſeth means to accompliſh he is ſaid to deſire; neither is <hi>God</hi> diſappointed if men neglect this means, for the juſtice of <hi>Gods</hi> mercie is to render to every man according
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119925:25"/>to his deeds, whether good or evill; as the mercie of his juſtice is to provide means of life or ſalvation, ſo that <hi>God</hi> is not diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the condemnation of any, for his mercie affordeth them means, and his juſtice condemnes them for contempt thereof, ſo that as <hi>God</hi> cannot worke againſt himſelf ſo therein he is neither croſſed nor contradicted, but remaineth in his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes intire and compleat.</p>
            <p>The next thing I ſhall ſpeak of, is the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of the means of grace, or the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of the means which <hi>God</hi> affords to worke grace or faith in every man; That the <hi>Goſpell</hi> was never publiſhed to men with plaineſſe and power, but they were thereby enabled to believe and yeeld obedience</p>
            <p>That <hi>God</hi> doth enlighten, invite, perſwade and draw all men to himſelf ſo farre, and ſo ſufficiently, that did they improve the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and price that <hi>God</hi> puts into their hands they ſhould certainely come to life and glory.</p>
            <p>It will be needfull (before I proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to declare what I meane by grace, and what I meane by the ſufficiency of the meanes of grace. <hi>Grace I conceive to bee an
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119925:26"/>humble and thankefull apprehenſion of the free love, favour, and goodneſſe of God:</hi> and when I ſpeake of the ſufficiency of the meanes which God affoords to worke grace in every man: I meane that God (by one meanes or other) doth diſcover himſelf to every man to be good and gracious. Now whereas it is urged, that men cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, they that ſo affirme ſay in effect that men have no ground to beleeve; for did they apprehend a ground for faith, they would never perſwade themſelves nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that they could not beleeve: but if they would have men to beleeve that the truth of which they cannot evidence or demonſtrate to them, then it is a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ready way for them to anticipate their underſtandings, and prevent them from inquiry, by telling them that they cannot beleeve, and that faith is beyond reaſon, and that God muſt perſwade their hearts, and ſo cauſe them to ceaſe to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their underſtandings, that they may worke their affections to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it upon truſt: and when they have ſo done, to tell them that God hath perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their hearts. Men ſay that faith is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119925:26"/>but how can it bee above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to beleeve that which we ſee ſufficient ground to beleeve; <hi>and to beleeve any thing, of which we have no plaine ground and reaſon, is ſo far from being above nature, that it is below it, and proper to fooles, and not to reaſonable men.</hi> It is true, that faith is the evidence or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things not ſeene, but the certainty of the things not ſeene, muſt be evidenced or manifeſted to us by things that doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, or wee cannot beleeve them: the meanes of grace which we now have, is not ſo great, nor ſo cleare, as the meanes which was afforded in the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and ſome others enjoy not ſo great meanes as we: but <hi>God requires of every man according to what he hath,</hi> and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he hath not. When the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to the Hebrewes doth declare to the Jews the danger of neglecting the Goſpel, he urgeth it from this Reaſon, that it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declared &amp; confirmed to them, <hi>being firſt spoken by the Lord himſelf, and then confirmed to them by thoſe which heard him, God alſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them witneſſe</hi> (that they ſpake truth) <hi>with ſignes and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Spirit, according to his owne will.</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:119925:27"/>Now how can we thinke that thoſe men could not beleeve that had the Goſpel ſo evidenced and confirmed before their eyes; or how could the ſignes and miracles be an aggravation of their ſinne in not beleeving, if they had not been a ſufficient meanes to procure their beleeving; and if they were a ſufficient meanes it muſt be ſo in reference to their naturall faculties; as <hi>Act.</hi> 8.16. the Samaritans <hi>gave heed with one accord to the things which Philip ſpake, hearing and ſeeing the miracles which hee did.</hi> And againe, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.33.34.35. <hi>When Peter had healed Aeneas, who had been ſicke of the Palſie eight yeares, all that dwelt at Lidda and Saron ſaw him, and turned to the Lord.</hi> Againe, <hi>when Peter raiſed Dorcas from the dead, it was knowne throughout all Ioppa, and many beleeved in the Lord,</hi> verſ. 42. and therefore the Diſciples (which Chriſt ſent out to preach) were commanded to tarry in Jeruſalem <hi>untill they were endued with power from on high, Luk.</hi> 24.49. which power was, the gifts of the holy Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them by ſignes and miracles, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and demonſtrate to every mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and conſcience (where they came) the truth of the things they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119925:27"/>as <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4.5.8. compared with chap. 2. verſ. 3.4. ſo that with great power did the Lord give witneſſe to the things ſpoken by Chriſt and his meſſengers, <hi>which miracles had been needleſſe, if faith had been a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gift immediately infuſed by God.</hi> We have the Scriptures, we ſee the wonderfull works of God, and partake of his goodneſſe every moment, and yet can we not beleeve, and from thence be perſwaded to love, ſerve, and obey the Lord? to love, ſerve, and obey him, I ſay; for to beleeve that Chriſt was ſent of God to dye for our ſinnes, or to beleeve God to be good and gracious, if I am not thereby perſwaded to love, ſerve, and obey him, my faith is nothing, it is dead being alone. Now let us further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is written <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>how ſhall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard, and how ſhall they heare without a Preacher? and how ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> plainly intimating, that there is a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for men to beleeve in Chriſt, when they heare him preached by the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God, and therefore in the 17. verſe he concludes that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God; ſo the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119925:28"/>goſpell is termed the Word of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. the preaching of the goſpel the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.23. hearing of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the hearing of faith preached, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2.5. and when the goſpel was preached to the gentiles, God is ſaid to have opend the door of faith unto them, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.27. and where God affoords the goſpel he affoords faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes in the like caſe <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>whereof he hath afforded faith to all men</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Againe, the goſpel is termed <hi>the power of God to ſalvation, Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>the power of God, and the wiſdome of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.24. and God is ſaid to ſave thoſe which beleeve by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. Now if the Word of God, the goſpel, be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto men, and yet they thereby not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to beleeve, then how is it the power of God to their ſalvation? they being to periſh if they beleeve not, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. for that meanes which is the power of God to an end, muſt needs be ſufficient for that end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh.</hi> You ſee it was not ſufficient, for all did not beleeve.</p>

               <hi>Anſw. Paul</hi> ſpeaks in this place, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation the goſpel had amongſt the ſons of men, how different their thoughts were of it, in the 18. verſe he ſaith, <hi>it is to them that periſh fooliſhneſſe,</hi> to us which are ſaved the power of God. In the 23.24. verſes he ſaith, the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> did ſtumble at it, and the unbelieving <hi>Greekes</hi> accompted it fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſſe, but the believing both of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Greekes,</hi> did eſteeme it the wildome of God, and the power of God: the unbelievers did not eſteeme rightly of it, the believers did; <hi>but if the goſpel were the power of God onely to believers, and to unbelievers a dead Letter, then unbelievers were as right in their thoughts (to whom it was fooliſhneſſe) as Believers to whom it was the wiſdome and power of God: yea it had bin fooliſhneſſe in unbelievers to have eſteemed it any other then fooliſhnes in point of their ſalvation, as a meanes unto which end it was propounded to them:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119925:29"/>for their condition was more deſperate conſidered with this meanes then before, it being unable to bring them to faith, and ſo to life, and yet bringing condemnation on them for their unbeliefe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.8.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>God</hi> upbraids one people with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, Mat. 11.20.21.22. <hi>then began hee to upbraid thoſe Cityes, wherein moſt of his mighty workes were done, becauſe they repented not; Wee untothee</hi> Corazin, <hi>and woe unto thee</hi> Bethſaida, <hi>for if the mighty workes which were done in you, had beene done in</hi> Tire <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have repented long agoe in ſackcloth and aſhes; but I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tollerable for</hi> Tire <hi>and</hi> Sidon <hi>at the day of Judgement, then for you,</hi> &amp;c</p>
            <p>Now <hi>God</hi> would not upbraid one people with another, if there were ſome ſpeciall meanes afforded to the one and not to the other, (which made all the difference) for without that meanes, then <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> could not repent, and with it <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> could not but repent; but the words doe plainely manifeſt, that the ſame meanes that was afforded to <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> (who repented not) would have cauſed <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> to repent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

            <p>Againe <hi>Romans</hi> 2.4, 5. The Apoſtle hath theſe words, <hi>deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and forbearance, and long ſuffering, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the goodnes of God leadeth thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby wee ſee that God la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by the riches of his goodneſſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and long ſuffering, to lead thoſe men to repentance, which notwithſtanding treaſure up to themſelves wrath, againſt the day of wrath. <hi>Now it is a vaine thing (and farre from God) to exerciſe forbearance, and long ſuffering in expectation of impoſſibilities, to waite when the Creature will doe that which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to performe;</hi> and then the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God could not (in any ſenſe) beè ſaid to lead wicked men to repentance, but to diſtruction and ruine, for if God forbeare never ſo long they cannot repent, and the wrath of God comes on them for deſpiſing his patience and forbearance and ſo the for bearance of God, (inſtead of being rich in goodneſſe) is rendred by this doctrine, rich in wrath, in fire and brimſtone; and ſuch goodnes might well be deſpiſed. If a Prince ſhould make great and rich promiſes to a ſubject, if he would run a hundred miles in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119925:30"/>one houre, and withall threaten to inflict ſome heavy puniſhment on him if he doe it not, when he knew it impoſsible for him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to run twenty, and then to waite many dayes on him for his performance; hee in his puniſhment being to pay for every houres forbearance, if in the end he did it not, might not ſuch pretended goodnes well be deſpiſed, and he alſo that ſhould pretend it to be goodneſſe. But I ſay it is evident by the forenamed place, that whil'ſt God did exerciſe his goodneſſe, long-ſuffering and forbearance towards them, they might have repented, and therefore the wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God comes on them, <hi>for not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the truth, but obeying unrighteouſnes,</hi> verſe the 8.</p>
            <p>Againe, if the goſpel were not ſufficient to enable men to believe, then it were as weake (in point of Salvation) as the Law, <hi>for the Law was holy, iuſt, and good,</hi> Rom. 7.12. and if it could have given life, righteouſnes ſhould have been by it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>but none could be iuſtified by the deeds of the Law, Gal.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>becauſe it was weake through the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. Now that which was impoſsible to the Law being weake (not in it ſelfe) but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119925:30"/>through the weakneſſe of the fleſh, GOD ſending his Sonne in the ſimilitude of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fleſh to die for ſinne, thereby condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſinne in the fleſh, and ſupplyed that weakeneſſe of men in the fleſh, and ſo made the way by faith to ſalvation feaſable to the Sons of men, <hi>verſe.</hi> 3,4. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22.24. The miniſtery of the Law is termed, <hi>the miniſtery of the Letter, of death of condemnation;</hi> the miniſtery of the Goſpell is termed, <hi>the miniſtery of the Spirit, of life, of righteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, 8, 9. Now theſe different termes doe evidently demonſtrate, that righteouſneſſe, life, and ſalvation, which was impoſsible for men (in reſpect of their weakeneſſe) to attaine by the Law, is made poſsible by the goſpel, notwithſtanding their weakneſſe; and if men in the ſtate of nature were unable to believe the goſpel when they heare it preached by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then it would be the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of life and righteouſneſſe no more then the Law was, for the Law was not the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of death in reſpect of it ſelf (for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> deſcribes the righteouſneſſe of the law, that <hi>the man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them,</hi> Rom. 10.5.) but in reſpect of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119925:31"/>weakneſſe of men to performe it; and <hi>Paul</hi> putting the goſpel in oppoſition to the law, ſaith, <hi>that the righteouſneſſe of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, ſay not in thy heart who ſhall aſcend into Heaven (that is to bring Chriſt downe from above) or who ſhall deſcend into the deepe (that is, to bring up Christ againe from the dead) but what ſaith it, the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart; that is, the word of faith which wee preach, that if thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Ieſus, and believe in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> verſe 6, 7, 8 9. but if men could not believe it when it was preached to them, it could not be ſaid to be nigh them, but as unpoſsible, and as farre out of their power, as it would bee for them to aſcend up to Heaven to bring Chriſt from above; or deſcend into the deepe, to bring up <hi>Christ</hi> again from the dead. And whereas it is ſaid to be nigh, it might be more properly ſaid to be farre off: ſo then the goſpel is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of life, not in it ſelfe only, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of mens power to believe it when it is preached, or declared to them; otherwiſe it would bee all one to bee under the Law and under grace, neither would the Goſpel
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119925:31"/>bring ſalvation any more then the law, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. but would unavoydably cauſe wrath to come upon the ſons of men, as the Law did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. and would leave them under the dominion of ſin as the Law did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 14. for as the Law threatned death, ſo doth the goſpel, <hi>Marke</hi> 16.16. and the ſame power which God puts forth (as is conceived) to enable men to believe, would have enabled them to keepe the Law; For it is conceived that (beſides the preaching of the goſpel and Gods bearing witneſſe to it, by ſignes and wonders) there was a ſpeciall and almighty power, exerciſed by <hi>God</hi> in all them that did believe, which power (I ſay) would have enabled them to keep the Law, <hi>ſo that there would bee no difference betweene the Law and the goſpel, and ſo Chriſt died in vaine,</hi> Gal. 2.21.</p>
            <p>Againe <hi>God</hi> in the Miniſtry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, called all men every where to repent, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30 To believe and yeeld obedience to the Goſpel upon pain of eternall death, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.48. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8.2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. 10 28 29. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.45.

Yea further, where it is ſaid, <hi>God ſo loved the World,</hi> Joh. 3.16. It were then more proper to ſay, God ſo hated the world, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God proclaimes himſelf in the goſpel to be love, to be gracious and mercifull to loſt men, this Doctrine proclaimes him to be wrath, hatred, anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Sons of men, for if ſalvation were not to be had by Chriſt, but through faith, and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came upon them through unbelief, and the condition of men were ſuch, that they could not believe, and God afforded them
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119925:36"/>no power, then the eternall ruine and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the moſt part of them, was an inevitable effect of the death of Chriſt, ſo that this Doctrine tends to the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the free grace of God in the goſpel.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Againe, men are charged with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſalvation; now, how can that bee neglected which was impoſſible to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained?</p>
            <p>Againe, thoſe that reject the goſpel, or meanes of grace, are ſaid to be guilty of the blood of their ſoules, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.6. whereas if the meanes uſed with them were not every way ſufficient to bring them to life, their rejecting of it could not make them guilty of their owne death and ruine.</p>
            <p>Again, God bemoanes and laments men that periſh, becauſe they did not make uſe of the means which he affoorded them for their recovery: <hi>O that my people had hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto me, and that Iſrael had walked in my wayes; but my people would not hearken unto me, and Iſrael would none of me,</hi> Pſal. 81. <hi>O Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, wilt thou not be made cleane? when ſhall it once be?</hi> Jer. 13.27. <hi>O that thou hadſt knowne in

            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> This is to advance the creature, and to give him occaſion of boaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This objection deceives many ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-hearted and well-meaning people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath a ſpecious pretence of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in advancing God, and throwing down the creature, though in truth it diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God, and fills men with pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees would pay tithes of Mint, Anniſe, and Cummin, and neglect Iudgment, Mercy, and Faith;</hi> ſo many men boaſt (and no more but boaſt) of making themſelves nothing, whileſt they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the juſtice, mercy, and faith of God, they ſtrain at a gnat (yea at a ſhadow) and ſwallow a Camell: for i deny the creature to have any thing but what he receives of God, and boaſting is proper for him that hath ſomething which he hath not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. Chriſt (I ſay) who is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith, is the gift of God and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel (which is the meanes of faith) is of God, and what the creature is he is of God; now ſeeing what the creature hath and is, he thus receives of God, there is no ground of boaſting, or of this objection.</p>
            <p>Againe <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. Chriſt tells his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,<note place="margin">Hee that hath nothing but what he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and doth nothing but his duty, hath no ground to boaſt of what he hath, or of what he doth.</note>

               <hi>Ob.</hi> Though what I have, I have of God, yet ſeeing another man hath received as much as I which man beleeves not, or doth not obey, I may thanke my ſelfe that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, or do obey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This concluſion ſeems very ſtrange, as though grace received were no grace, if there were a poſſibility in the receiver to have rejected, reſiſted, or abuſed it, when it was manifeſted or declared.</p>
            <p>Again, whence is it that it is ſo hard and difficult for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of heaven? <hi>Mark</hi> 10.23. for if God doth ſo worke in men both to will and to doe, that they are altogether paſſive, (as men generally conceive) then it was as eaſie for a rich man to receive and obey the goſpel, as a poor man; for, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119925:39"/>of darkneſſe, <hi>that it hideth not from God, but that the night ſhineth as the day and that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and light are both alike to him, Pſal.</hi> 139.12. ſo may I ſay in this caſe, that if it be that Almighty power which raiſed Chriſt from the dead, which is exerciſed in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner towards every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves (as is uſually urged from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.) then riches and poverty are both alike to it, and it is as eaſie for one to enter into the Kingdome of heaven as the other; for without this ſpeciall grace (ſay they) (not the common and ordinary meanes which he affoords all men where the goſpel is preached) we may as well raiſe our ſelves from the dead as beleeve the goſpel: and with this ſpeciall grace and almighty power we cannot but beleeve and yeeld obedience to the truth Now ſeeing that where God is the ſole agent, all things are alike eaſie to be performed, what life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines there in the words of Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this doctrine) but wee may ſee in the hiſtory, that this young man came to Chriſt with ſtrong deſires and affections to attaine eternall life, <hi>for he came running, and kneeled downe to him, and asked him, ſaying,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119925:39"/>good Maſter, what ſhall I doe that I may inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite eternall life,</hi> verſ. 17. Chriſt anſwereth him, <hi>Doe not commit adultery, doe not kill, doe not ſteale, doe not beare falſe witneſſe; honour thy father and mother,</hi> verſ. 19. the young man replyes, <hi>that he had obſerved all theſe from his youth,</hi> verſ. 20. and the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt beholding him loved him, and ſaid unto him, one thing thou lackeſt, goo thy way, ſell what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou haſt and give to the poore, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven; and come take up thy croſſe and follow me,</hi> verſ. 21.

            <p>Againe, God forbids men to have reſpect
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119925:40"/>of perſons in judgement, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.16.17.19. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15. and he declares in his word, <hi>that hee will Iudge every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his workes,</hi> Prov. 24.12.

Rev. 22.12. <hi>without reſpect of perſons,</hi> Col. 3.25. as <hi>Peter</hi> writes unto Believers, in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. and hee that will give righteouſneſſe, judgment, without reſpect of perſons, muſt conſider every circumſtance, he muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meanes and opportunities to doe, or not to doe, aſwell as the thing done or not done, and accordingly Chriſt in the parable doth as much commend him, that by two talents had got other two, as hee that by five had got five, becauſe they were alike profitable according to the price that was put into their hands: But if God give faith to one man and not to another, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire faith of both alike at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if God open one mans eyes to ſee, his eares to heare, and over-power his heart to the obedience of his will; and ſo leaves the other, that he can neither ſee, heare, nor bee obedient, and then require obedience from both alike at the day of Judgement; how then doth God Judge without reſpect
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119925:40"/>of perſons? <hi>he might then bee ſaid to judge men according to his owne worke, but not according to their workes,</hi> as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35. and in divers other places hee is ſaid to doe. The Saints are promiſed to walke with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in white, for they are worthy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. thoſe that indure tribulations and perſecutions for Chriſts ſake, God accounts them worthy of his Kingdome, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. and of the world to come, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35. and to eſcape the evils which ſhall overtake the wicked, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 21.36. not that they merit or deſerve any thing at the hands of God, for when they have done all, they arebut unprofitable ſervants, they have done but what was their duty to doe; <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. but God is pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themworthy, they being worthy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comparatively, being compared with the wicked, covetous, unbelieving, &amp;c. whom the Scripture calls unworthy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37.22.8. of good, and worthy of evill, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.6, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Saints, <hi>it is a iuſt thing with God, to recompence tribulation to them which trouble you, and to you that are troubled reſt with us,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.6, 7. but if that ſpeciall power which God puts forth to the one and not to the other make all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119925:41"/>then no man is more worthy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy then another, for if he whcih now periſheth for his diſobedience, had partaken of that ſpeciall grace of God, he would have been obedient and ſo have been ſaved; and he that was obedient, if he had had no more meanes then the other, hee would have bin altogether as wicked as he; ſo then conſider the thing done or not done, with the meanes afforded, and all men are alike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy both of Heaven and Hell, <hi>for there being no difference betweene them, but what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath wrought, there can bee no difference in their ſentence, if they be iudged according to their workes,</hi> and God will doe nothing which ſhall be any way unſuitable to that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and impartiality which he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he doth and will exerciſe towards the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>Againe <hi>Proverbes</hi> 1.20. <hi>wiſdome cryeth without, ſhee uttereth her voice in the ſtreots, ſhee cryeth in the chiefe place of concourſe, in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Gates in the City, ſhee openeth her words, ſaying, how long yee ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity? and the ſcorners delight in their ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and fooles hate knowledge? Turne you at my reproofe; behold I will poure out my ſpirit unto

Then ſhall they call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee, but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not find me, for that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted knowledge, and did not chuſe the feare of the Lord.

Therefore ſhall they eat the fruit of their owne way, and bee filled with their owne devices; for the turning away, or eaſe of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of fooles ſhall deſtroy them; but who ſo hearkeneth unto me ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall bee quiet from feare of evill.</hi> In theſe words, firſt we perceive that wiſdome cryes to ſimple ones, ſcorners, and fooles, which hate knowledge, to turn from their folly at her reproofe, and withall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to poure out her ſpirit upon them, and make knowne her words unto them; now if theſe men were deafe and could not heare, it were a vaine thing for wiſdome to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119925:42"/>cry and utter her voice; If they were ſo ſimple, ſuch fooles, that could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what Wiſdome ſpake, without ſome other power, then the queſtion was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be demanded of them, how long they would love ſimplicity, delight in ſcorning, and hate knowledge, for they muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity love ſimplicity, and hate knowledge, untill God change their hearts: but in the 24 verſ. Wiſdome begins to threaten them, becauſe they refuſed her call, regarded not the ſtretching out of her hand, ſet at naught all her Counſell, and would none of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe; that ſhe would laugh at their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and mocke when their feare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Novv what ground hath Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to bee thus offended with theſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones for refuſing her call, ſeeing they could not heare it? for not regarding the ſtretching out of her hand, they not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it? and for ſetting at naught that counſell and reproofe of hers, which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled them being dead and not able to ſtir to turne from folly to wiſedome, without inabling them ſo to doe. And whereas ſome conceive that they are cryed upon, and that wiſdome is offended with them in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119925:42"/>relation towhat they had beſtowed on them in <hi>Adam;</hi> 'its plaine that ſhee cryes upon them in relation to the meanes and ability, which ſhe afforded them, being ſimple ones and fallen, and thereupon doth ſhee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt her indignation becauſe they did hate knowledge, and when wiſedome and folly was before them, did chuſe or preferre folly before wiſdome, they deſpiſed her counſel, loved their owne wayes and devices, untill their proſperity brought them to ruine and deſtruction. And beſides the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what they had received before they were fallen, makes wiſdoms calling and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them being fallen, nevertheleſſe vain, for it could not effect the end propoſed, their turning from folly, neither did it give her any further ground of anger, or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then what ſhee had before this meanes was uſed with them, for this meanes was no meanes in reſpect to their preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therfore it could bring no guilt on them in reſpect to their preſent condition.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>God calls all men every where to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> Act. 17.30. Chriſt promiſed <hi>to draw all men to himſelfe,</hi> Joh. 12.32. <hi>he is the true light that lighteth every man that commeth into the

And the Objection which is uſually made (that theſe and ſuch like expreſsions are meant only of the outward means which God affords) is to no purpoſe, <hi>for when God perſwades, or drawes any man to himſelf, he doth it in a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n all way</hi> and whether the reaſons, motives, or arguments are preſented to the mind, through the eare, or through the eye, or through neither of theſe, the arguments are the ſame, neither more nor leſſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and theſe diſpoſitions, inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and perſwaſions which men ſo much plead for (as the powerfull workings of <hi>Gods</hi> ſpirit in them) yet thinking it unreaſonable to have a reaſon demanded of them, are but dreams and deluſions, for God would have no man to ſtep one foot for him but upon rationall grounds, <hi>he would have men to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, believe nothing, hope for nothing but what they ſee ground and reaſon to do, believe, and hope for;</hi> elſe how ſhould they be able to give a reaſon of the hope that is in them to every man that ſhall aske it of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119925:43"/>When <hi>Abraham</hi> was promiſed a numerous ſeed, he conſidered not his owne body now dead, when he was about 100. yeares old, neither yet the deadneſſe of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb, he ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God, and all from this rationall conſideration or concluſion, that <hi>what God had promiſed he was able to perſorme, Rom.</hi> 4.19, 20, 21. So alſo when he was commanded to offen up his Sonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the child of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in whom his ſeed was to be called; yet he doth it readily, from this rationall conſideration, <hi>that God was able to raiſe him up even from the dead, from whence alſo he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him in a figure,</hi> Heb. 11.17, 18, 19. The ſervice of God is a reaſonable ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. and Chriſt tells the <hi>lewes</hi> that <hi>if he had not done amongſt them the works which none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man did, they had not been to blame in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him,</hi> Joh. 15.24. and therefore their condemnation lay in this, that they had ſeen and yet hated him and his Father: when Chriſt blames the unbelief of his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.8. he doth it by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reaſon, <hi>O yee of little faith, why rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon yee amongſt your ſelves becauſe yee have

            <p>If theſe men which periſhed in unbelief in the midſt of means, were dead and blind in ſuch ſort as men generally conceive they

It were a needles thing for <hi>Satan</hi> to blind the eyes of naturall men, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpell of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſhine unto them, if they had no eyes to ſee and receive this glorious light of the goſpel when it was declared to them; for if it were impoſsible for men to receive the light of the glorious Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> when it was preached to them, then they were as blind as the Divell could make them in point of receiving the goſpel, and the Divell needed not to adde this ſecond blindnes, leſt the light of the goſpel ſhould ſhine unto them. But indeed men are not blind for want of eyes, but for want of light, and when light or truth is diſcovered to them, they have faculties ſo ſuteable, fit and apt to receive it, that unleſſe the God

            <p>Again, <hi>God</hi> proceeds in ſuch a way which the Sons of Men that are fallen (even with Heathens, thoſe that never heard of the goſpel) that they may be without excuſe: For Gods doing good to men, <hi>giving them Raine from Heaven, and fruitfull ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food and gladnes,</hi> is an evident teſtimonie of his love and goodneſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. <hi>and Gods eternall power and God-head is clearly ſeen by the workes which he hath made, ſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119925:45"/>that all men were and are without excuſe in theſe reſpects,</hi> Rom. 1.20. But if when men had Chriſt preached to them, they were unable to believe, then they were not without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe under that, which was the greateſt means, for God required thoſe which heard the goſpel to believe it, and not giving them faith, they had this excuſe, that they could not believe, and this was ſuch an excuſe as would not admit of an accuſation from a God of mercie, much leſſe of ſuch ſevere puniſhment as is to be inflicted on ſuch as have diſobeyed the goſpel.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God doth not afford men meanes now they are fallen, to leave them without excuſe in relation to what hee gave them before they were fallen: for all the meanes which God uſeth with them, being fallen, leaves them never the more excuſeleſſe in that reſpect, ſo that the means uſed to ſuch an end, would be vaine and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Further conſider, if the loſſe of <hi>Adams Innocency</hi> leave all men without excuſe, that is, bring all under the curſe of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119925:46"/>in Hell, then there could be no redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any: For to the tranſgreſsion of <hi>what</hi> the ſeverity of his juſtice is referred, to the obedience of <hi>that</hi> the goodnes of his mercy muſt be confined; for both reſpect one object, his mercy the obedience, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity the diſobedience thereof, elſe God would be divided in himſelf, or rob'd of his Attributes, for ſhould he ſave ſome in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſt, and damne others in reſpect of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſimply, without reſpect to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of Chriſt, there could neither be mercy in the one, nor juſtice in the other, for both would be void of equity. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall to ſave for that, the denyall whereof is not the object of condemnation; or to damne for that, the obedience whereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, or ſalvation by it: So that if the loſſe of the ſtate of innocency be the cauſe for which the equity of his juſtice leaveth all without excuſe, and for which its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity executes eternall damnation in Hell, then there can be no ſalvation at all for any, becauſe the thing is not, nor can be, by which ſalvation ſhould be, to wit, <hi>Innocency</hi> recalled, and all fallen equally from it, as all were equally in the loynes of the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119925:46"/>Therefore the loſt ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in reſpect of <hi>Adam,</hi> can render us neither excuſable nor inexcuſable in reſpect of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the objects are different. <hi>Adam</hi> hath his doom on himſelf and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to wit, mortallity, the which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt did not, prevent, but it muſt paſſe over all, and then comes in Chriſts Redemption, <hi>an endleſſe immortallity,</hi> which hath its own extrems, Salvation by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, condemnation by diſobedience; as the other had, continuance of that ſtate if he forbore the <hi>forbidden fruit,</hi> Death <hi>in the day that he did eat thereof;</hi> So that the <hi>clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> of his <hi>mercie,</hi> and the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of his <hi>juſtice,</hi> was and is ever verſant in the <hi>obedience</hi> or <hi>diſobedience</hi> of one and the ſame thing, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one whoſe reſtored immortality is eternally condemned in Hell, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is of himſelfe, and not of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the torments of the damned in Hell, many conceive that the paine of loſſe which they ſhall indure, will be greater then the pain of ſence; but if thoſe that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh had not ſuch ſufficiency of means af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them, as that they might have come
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119925:47"/>to life and happines, then there can be no pain of loſſe to any of them, for that which a man never had, nor never was in poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to obtaine, he can in no ſenſe be ſaid to loſe the conſideration of all that glory the Saints injoy affords them no ground to check or blame themſelves, for ſeeing they themſelves (by all the means which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded) could not attaine unto it, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame themſelves for not being poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it, yea, inſtead of trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and anguiſh of ſoul in this reſpect, they may have ſome comfort and eaſe from this conſideration, that their miſerie was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable and the others glory not attainable by them.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that they loſt what God gave them in <hi>Adam,</hi> and this may be horror of conſcience to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No man ſhall ever periſh in Hell for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, as is already manifeſted, but if they ſhould, yet ſtill the caſe would be alike. for they were loſt before they were born, and they have no more reaſon to blame themſelves for what <hi>Adam</hi> did before they were borne, then an Heire hath reaſon to blame himſelf becauſe his father ſpent
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119925:47"/>his inheritance before he was borne.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſpeake ſomewhat of thoſe Scriptures which are uſually urged againſt the univerſallity of Gods love, ſome of them ſpeaking of Gods hardening of men, ſo that they could not believe, others of his withholding that meanes from them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they could not attaine unto faith, and ſo unto eternall life. And firſt I ſhall begin with thoſe Scriptures which ſpeak of Gods hardning of men, &amp; amongſt them with the 9. chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the 11 verſ. to the 23. from whence the great and main Objections are gathered, the words are theſe: <hi>For this is the word of promiſe, at this time will I come, and</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhall have a Sonne, and not onely this, but when</hi> Rebecka <hi>alſo had conceived by one, even by our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Iſaac, <hi>for the children being not yet borne, neither having done any good or evill, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth, it was ſaid unto her, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> as it is written, <hi>Iacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated: what ſhall we ſay then, is there unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe with God? Godforbid:</hi> for he ſaith to Moſes, <hi>I will have mercie on whom I will have
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119925:48"/>mercie, and I will have compaſsion on whom I will have compaſsion, ſo then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of</hi> God <hi>that ſheweth mercie,</hi> for the Scripture ſaith unto Pharoah, <hi>even for this purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth: therefore hath he mercie on whom he will have mercie, and whom he will he hardeneth. Thou wilt ſay then unto me, why doth he yet find fault? for who hath reſiſted his will? Nay, but O man who art thou that replyest againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? hath not the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power over the clay, of the ſame lump, to make one Veſſell unto honour, and another unto diſhonour. What if God willing to ſhew his wrath and to make his power known, indured with much long ſuffering the Veſſells of wrath ficted to deſtruction, and that he might make knowne the riches of his glory on the Veſſells of mercie, whom he hath afore prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we ſay that God would the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all, they tell us that God did hate the moſt part before they had done evill, as he did <hi>Elau.</hi> If we ſay that God uſeth means to ſoften all mens hearts to bring them to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119925:48"/>repentance, they ſay that as he ſhewes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to ſome in this kind, ſo he hardens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that meerly of his will, he hath mercie on whom he will, and whom hee will he hardeneth: If we ſay that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuteable to God who is love, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.8. to the goſpel, which brings <hi>ſalvation to all,</hi> Tit. 2.11. which is glad tydings of great joy to all people, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10. to all the la mentations, Proteſtations, and profeſsions of God in the goſpel, they tell us, we muſt not diſpute with God, and though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it out, we ought to believe it. They ſay <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was at a ſtand in this thing and could give no other anſwer, but that God might doe with us as the Potter with the clay, make ſome of us for Heaven and others for Hell, and that we ought not to ſay unto him, what doeſt thou? ſo that men from a miſunderſtanding of this Chapter, doe ſtrengthen themſelves againſt the moſt plaineſt and evidenteſt arguments that are or can be drawn from what the Scriptures ſpeak, of the nature of God, or of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, anſwering all in the words of <hi>Paul.</hi> [Nay, but O man who art thou that diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with God?] Yet we know that it was
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119925:49"/>uſuall with the Saints in former times to draw concluſions and arguments from the Attributes of God: ſo <hi>Abraham; ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth dee right,</hi> Gen. 18.25. But if God be bound to no law, how can he be unjuſt? or if <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have comprehended what had bin juſt, and what unjuſt for God to doe, he would not in the preſence of God have ſo determined as he did. The Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> having ſpoken of the promiſe and Oath of God to bleſſe the Heires of promiſe, adds theſe words, That by two immutable things in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation, who are fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. but if we affirm that notwithſtanding all the promiſes and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of God to doe good unto men in his revealed will and word, he may in his ſecret will intend the contrary, what do we leſſe then affirme that God may lye? Againe the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> uſeth this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to perſwade the Saints to perſevere in well doing. That God was not unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to forget their work and labour of love that they ſhewed towards his name, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.10.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119925:49"/>And againe he perſwades them to bee content with ſuch things as they had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had ſaid hee would not leave them nor forſake them, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.5. but if they had thought that God might have a ſecret will, which might not agree with what he reveales, it would not have been ſufficient ſatisfaction for <hi>Paul</hi> to tell them that <hi>God had ſaid it,</hi> unleſſe he could make it alſo to appeare that he meant and intended what he ſpake: we are alſo to be like our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and eſpecially in this, that we love the evill, the unjuſt, our enemies, thoſe that hate, curſe, perſecute, and deſpightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44, 45, 48. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.35, 36. but if Gods love in beſtowing means and mercies on the wicked, be to harden them, to make them veſſells of wrath, on which he may ſhew his wrath, and make his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er known, who amongſt our ſelves would not be aſhamed to ſhew mercie according to ſuch a patterne? to do men good, that wee may have occaſion to inflict evill; its like the mercy of thoſe, which when by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have almoſt deprived a man of life, will give him ſome Cordiall to revive him, that they may further torment him,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119925:50"/>but God is righteous, juſt, gracious, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſincere, faithfull, and all his promiſes and his proffers are in truth. And what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. I may ſay of God, who though he be without law, (he being Lord of all) yet he is a Law to himſelf; he wills and doth all things ſutea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his nature, to his Attributes, and he may aſwell ceaſe to be, as to will or doe other.</p>
            <p>But againſt this Doctrine ſome do <hi>Object</hi> what is written, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.12. and 3.22. where God bids <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeake unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to borrow every man of his Neighbour, and every woman of her Neighbour, Jewells of Silver, and Jewells of Gold; now ſay they it had been wickedneſſe in them to borrow, with an intent never to repay, if God had not commanded them, but ſeeing he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them they did well; for the will, word, or command of God, is ſufficient to prove any thing good and juſt (though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare unjuſt to us) and therefore wee muſt not diſpute it further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I grant that ſeeing God doth neither will nor command any thing but what is juſt, his will, word, or command, is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119925:50"/>ſufficient to prove any thing to be juſt: But ſecondly, ſeeing God wils and commands nothing but what is juſt, and hath given us reaſon and underſtanding to judg what is juſt, and vvhat is unjuſt, it concernes us to be very carefull (as wee tender the honour and glory of God) that wee believe no word to be ſpoken, nor action done by <hi>God,</hi> which vve our ſelves ſee to bee unjuſt: for if wee profeſſe to believe God to be love, juſt, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, ſincere, faithfull; and yet believe that <hi>God</hi> made ſome men to deſtroy them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pre-conſideration of any evill or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe which they would commit, that he commands men to performe this or that thing, and then poſsitively hardens them that they may not doe it; and yet puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them for not performing of it; that God in his revealed will, profeſſeth to love men, and to deſire their good and ſalvation, and yet in his ſecret will intends their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: that he ſhould teach his people to borrow (promiſing to repay) but inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to deceive and ſpoile: it is all one as if wee ſhould profeſſe to believe that ſuch a man were very honeſt, juſt and good; and yet withall to ſay, that he would lye, ſteale,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119925:51"/>murther, beare falſe Witneſſe and the like; which things are inconſiſtent in man, as the former are in <hi>God,</hi> and hee that doth indeed beleeve the one of God cannot poſsible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the other: Novv the word which we have tranſlated <hi>borrow</hi> doth properly ſignifie <hi>Aske,</hi> they ſhall aske every Woman of her Neighbour, &amp;c. and ſo there is no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the Words, for the <hi>Jewes</hi> were a long time oppreſſed by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who had made them ſlaves, and ſerved themſelves of them; now vvhen the <hi>Egyptians</hi> vvere ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and did haſt to ſend them avvay, as a recompence to them, God bids them to ask Jewells of Silver, Jewells of Gold, and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo they ſhould cloth their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with the ſpoile of their enemies and oppreſſors, which was but equall and juſt.</p>
            <p>But now I ſhall ſhew what I conceive to be the meaning of the 9. of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and for the better underſtanding of it, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to take notice with me, of the drift and ſcope of <hi>Paul</hi> therein. In the 1, 2, &amp; 3. verſes, <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſolemnely and ſeriouſly profeſſe his heavineſſe and ſorrow of heart for his Brethren and Kinſmen according to the fleſh, <hi>who</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>are Iſraelites, to whom
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119925:51"/>pertaineth the adoption, the glory, the Covenants, the giving of the Law, the ſervice of God and the promiſes, whoſe are the Fathers, and of whom as concerning the Fleſh Chriſt came, who is over all God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Amen. verſe the 4 and 5. then in the beginning of verſe 6. <hi>Paul</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents an objection which might be made to this effect; If we who are <hi>Iſraelites, to whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the adoption, the glory, the Covenants, the giving of the Law, the ſervice of</hi> God, <hi>and the promiſes,</hi> come ſhort of righteouſnes, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, life and ſalvation; then the Word of GOD, the faith of GOD, the promiſe of God takes not effect; like unto that which is Written, Chap. 3. 3. <hi>what if ſome did not believe, ſhall their unbeliefe make the faith of God without effect:</hi> Make the word and promiſe of God falſe) God forbid, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> verſ. 4. yea let God be true, but every man a lyar, &amp;c. Now in this place <hi>Paul</hi> endeavours to Anſwer this Objection more at large, from the latter part of the 6. Verſe, to the end of the Chapter, <hi>ſo that the thing which Paul in this Chapter undertakes to prove, is, that though many, yea the moſt of the</hi> Jewes <hi>ſhould periſh in their wickedneſſe and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, yet God would be juſt, righteous, and true, in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119925:52"/>all his words and workes; and that every jot and tittle of his word would take effect.</hi> And firſt Paul tells them that they were miſtaken, in that they did conceive themſelves the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, becauſe they were Children of the fleſh of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>all are not Iſrael, that are of Iſrael, neither becauſe they are the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>are they all children, but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed bee called, that is, they which are the children of the Fleſh, are not the Children of God, but the Children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed,</hi> verſe 6.7, and 8. for ſaith Paul, this is a word of promiſe, <hi>at this time I will come and</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhall have a Son,</hi> ver. 9. ſo that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a child of promiſe and ſo muſt you or your being children of the fleſh will profit you little; and this is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly expounded in the 4. Chapter of the <hi>Galatians, verſe</hi> 21. to the end of the Chapter, <hi>Tell me</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>yee that deſire to be under the Law, doe yee not heare the Law, for it is written that</hi> Abraham <hi>had two Sonnes, the one by a Bond-woman, the other by a free-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but he who was of the bond-woman, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, but he that was of the free-woman was by promiſe, which things are an allegory, for theſe are the two Covenants or Teſtaments, the one
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119925:52"/>from Mount Sinai, which gendreth to bondage, which is Hagar; for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and anſwereth to Ieruſalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children: but Ieruſalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all, (that is, of us beleevers:) for it is written, Rejoice thou barren that beareſt not, breake forth and cry thou that travaileſt not, for the deſolate hath many more children then ſhee which hath an husband. Now wee brethren</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Paul <hi>to the Galatians</hi>) <hi>as Iſaac was, are the children of the promiſe; but as then he that was borne after the fleſh perſecuted him that was borne after the spirit, even ſo it is now. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe what ſaith the Scripture? Caſt out the bond-woman and her Sonne, for the Sonne of the bond woman</hi> (the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh) <hi>ſhall not be heire with the Sonne of the free-woman,</hi> (ſuch as beleeve ſuch as walke in the ſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.12) ſo that whereas you Jewes reſt in the Law, and thinke therein to have eternall life; you thinke the Law will juſtifie you, but the Law condemnes you; that is, the words and writing of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which are here termed the Law: for though <hi>Iſhmael</hi> were the childe of <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:119925:53"/>as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet you ſee God would not ſuffer him to inherite, but he muſt be caſt out; therefore your being children of the fleſh is not ſufficient to make you heires of that promiſe which was made to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Paul</hi> proceeds to another inſtance of the like nature in the 10.11, and 12. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>and not onely this, but when Rebecca alſo had conceived by one, even by our Father Iſaac; for the children being not yet borne, neither having done any good or evill, that the purpoſe of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to election might ſtand, not of workes, but of him that calleth, it was ſaid unto her, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, that which I affirme doth not onely appeare by what is written of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> but by that alſo which is written of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the children of <hi>Rehecca which ſhe conceived by one, even by our father Iſaac:</hi> for though <hi>Eſau</hi> were <hi>Jacobs</hi> brother, the elder, the greater, and heire according to the fleſh, yet God ſaid that he (that is, his poſterity; for <hi>Eſau</hi> never ſerved <hi>Iacob</hi> in perſon, but rather on the contrary <hi>Iacob</hi> ſerved <hi>Eſau,</hi> and called him Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.14.) ſhould ſerve (the poſterity of) <hi>Iacob</hi> the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119925:53"/>younger. Now theſe words were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of what God would doe unto the Edomites for their wickedneſſe; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it to <hi>Rebecca before the children were borne, before they had done good or evill,</hi> that from the beginning he might manifeſt and make appeare that his purpoſe was not to juſtifie any one of you by workes, but by grace; not to juſtifie the whole lump of you, but to elect and chuſe out from among you ſuch as ſhould beleeve and be obedient, they, and they onely being the ſeed and true heires, according to the intent of the promiſe made to your father <hi>Abraham;</hi> and therefore neither your naturall birth, nor any legall or outward performance, will make you accepted of God, or give you inheritance in the promiſes of life: for this of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> (like the former of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi>) is an Allegory of the two Covenants, <hi>Eſau</hi> being Lord by birth, but <hi>Iacob</hi> by the fore-appointment of God; ſo you Jewes, and you onely, are children and heires according to the fleſh; but believers (as believers) and they onely, both of Jews and Gentiles, according to the purpoſe and election of God: then in the 13. verſe hee
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119925:54"/>proceeds with theſe words, as it is written, <hi>Iacob</hi> have I loved, but <hi>Eſau</hi> have I hated, (the following words in <hi>Malachi</hi>) and laid his mountaines and his heritage waſte for the dragons of the wilderneſſe; whereas Edom ſaith we are impoveriſhed, but will returne and build the deſolate places, thus ſaith the Lord of hoſtes, They ſhall build, but I will throw downe, and they ſhall call them the borders of wickedneſſe, and the people againſt whom the Lord hath indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for ever: as if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have ſaid, What God intended in his ſpeech to <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> is more clearly manifeſted by what is written in the propheſie of <hi>Malachi,</hi> where you finde that though <hi>Eſau</hi> were <hi>Ianobs</hi> brother, (that is, the Edomites were bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to the Iſraelites) yet God hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> (that is, the Edomites) and laid their mountaines and heritage waſte, for the dragons of the wilderneſſe, and his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was ſet againſt them for ever ſo that it is a vaine thing for you Jewes to plead for your juſtification, that you are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (unleſſe you walke in his ſteps;) for the Edomites could do as much as that, and yet were deſtroyed for their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119925:54"/>wickedneſſe: and that this puniſhment came upon them for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though this place in <hi>Malachi</hi> doth manifeſt it, yet I ſhall produce ſome other Scriptures more fully to evidence the ſame: <hi>Ezech.</hi> 25.12, 13, 14. Thus ſaith the Lord, becauſe Edom hath dealt againſt the houſe of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended and revenged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon them: Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, I will alſo ſtretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beaſt from it, and I will make it deſolate from Teman, and they of Dedan ſhall fall by the ſword, and I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Iſrael, and they ſhall doe to Edom according to my anger, and according to my fury, and they ſhall know my vengeance, ſaith the Lord. <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.19. Edom ſhall be a deſolate wilderneſſe, for the violence againſt the children of Judah, becauſe they have ſhed innocent bloud in their land. <hi>Ames</hi> 1.11. Thus ſaith the Lord, for three tranſgreſsions of Edom, and for foure, I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof, becauſe he did purſue his brother with the ſword, and did caſt off all pity,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119925:55"/>and his anger did teare perpetually, and kept his wrath for ever. And in <hi>Obadiah</hi> the whole chapter ſpeakes of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Edomites, and Gods anger againſt them, eſpecially from the 9. verſe to the end of the chapter: And thy mighty men, O Teman, ſhall bee diſmayed, to the end that every one of the Mount of Eſau may be cut off by ſlaughter, for thy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt thy brother Jacob ſhame ſhall cover thee, and thou ſhalt bee cut off for ever. In the day that thou ſtoodeſt on the other ſide, in the day that the ſtrangers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away captive his forces, and forreiners entred into his gates, and caſt lots upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; even thou waſt as one of them. But thou ſhouldeſt not have looked on the day of thy brother, in the day that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſtranger; neither ſhouldſt thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their deſtruction; neither ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou have ſpoken proudly in the day of diſtreſſe, thou ſhouldeſt not have entred into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; neither ſhouldſt thou have ſtood in the croſſe way, to cut off thoſe of his that did eſcape; neither ſhouldſt thou
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119925:55"/>have delivered up thoſe of his that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the day of diſtreſſe: for the day of the Lord is neare upon all the heathen; as thou haſt done it ſhall be done unto thee, thy reward ſhall returne upon thine owne head, &amp;c. The evill and unkind carriage of the Edomites towards their brethren the Iſraelites, is more fully declared in the 20 chapter of Numbers, the 14 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20 and 21 verſes: And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers from Kadeſh unto the King of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſaying, Thus ſaith thy brother Iſrael, thou knoweſt all the travell that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen us, how our fathers went downe into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians vexed us and our Fathers; and when wee cryed unto the Lord, he heard our voice, and ſent an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and behold we are in Kadeſh, a City in the uttermoſt of thy border, let us paſſe I pray thee thorow thy countrey, wee will not paſſe thorow the fields, or thorow the vineyards neither will wee drinke of the water of the wells; we will go by the Kings high way, wee will not turne to the right hand or to the left, untill we have paſſed thy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119925:56"/>borders. And Edom ſaid unto him, Thou ſhalt not paſſe by me, leſt I come out againſt thee with the ſword. And the children of Iſrael ſaid unto him, Wee will goe by the high way, and if I and my cattell drinke of thy water then I will pay for it: I will only (without doing any thing elſe) goe thorow on my feet: And he ſaid, Thou ſhalt not goe thorow. And Edom came out againſt him with much people, and with a ſtrong hand; and Edom refuſed to give Iſrael paſſage thorow his border, wherefore Iſrael turned away from him. Here we ſee how hardly the Edomites dealt with their brethren in the day of their diſtreſſe, for which cauſe the Lord was diſpleaſed with them; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> would have the Jewes to underſtand that God would be diſpleaſed with them, and puniſh them, and deſtroy them, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Abraham</hi> was their Father, and notwithſtanding any promiſe he had made to them) if they were rebellious and diſobedient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> had thought that the hatred of God towards <hi>Eſau,</hi> or the Edomites, had beene for his, or their wickedneſſe, hee would have ſo expreſſed himſelfe, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119925:56"/>not have left the matter ſo obſcure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Jewes pleaded for their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that they were the children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; Paul</hi> proves that ſome of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> were hated of God; and to have told them wherefore, had been ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and not pertinent to the argument in hand.</p>
            <p>But if that purpoſe and election, which <hi>Paul</hi> laboured to eſtabliſh amongſt the Jewes had been this, That God did elect and chuſe out ſome of them to life; and hate, or leave (as ſome interpret the word <hi>hate</hi>) the reſidue to deſtruction, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any good or evill in them, (and that that counſell of his did alway take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) he would not have had ſuch great hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe, and continuall ſorrow of heart for them as verſ. 2. for then he ſhould have ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed becauſe the purpoſe and counſell of God took effect, he could not then ſo love them, as cordially to deſire their ſalvation; chap. 10.1. if he had known that God in his eternall and unalterable counſell had ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them as to leave them for deſtruction. Beſides, God reaſons with <hi>Iacobs</hi> poſterity <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. that he loved them (that is <hi>all of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119925:57"/>them</hi>) and yet many, yea the moſt of them, periſhed notwithſtanding this love, as in chap. 9. 27. therefore it was no ſuch love as would ſave them unleſſe they were thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obedient; and ſeeing it would not infallibly ſave all thoſe that were ſo loved, it was not ſuch a love of election as ſome men conceive.</p>
            <p>Further conſider, God is not willing that any of the loſt ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, he deſires not the death of him that dieth; he doth not delight in tormenting his creatures; he is excellent in judgement, and in plenty of juſtice he will not afflict, <hi>Iob</hi> 37.23. He doth not willingly afflict, nor grieve the children of men, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. but if God ſhould hate men with an eternall and unchangeable hatred before they had done evill, where then were his unwillingneſſe to afflict, his ſlowneſſe to wrath, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to all, and the like?</p>
            <p>Then hee proceeds in the 14. verſe to make an objection; What ſhall we ſay then, or what doe we ſay then, that there is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe with God? God forbid ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> for wee in thus expounding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Scriptures ſay no more then
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119925:57"/>God himſelfe ſaith to <hi>Moſes Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion:</hi> The Iſraelites had made them a molten Calfe, and worſhipped it, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed thereunto, and ſaid, <hi>Theſe be thy gods, O Iſrael, that brought thee out of the land of Egypt,</hi> chap. 32.4.8. wherefore the Lord was angry with them, and willed <hi>Moſes</hi> to let him alone that hee might conſume them, and he promiſed to make of <hi>Moſes</hi> a great Nation: but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtill entreats for the Iſraelites, and in the 32 verſe he is ſo earneſt for them, that he deſires God to blot him out of the book which he had written, if ſo that he would forgive their ſinnes: but the anſwere of God is, <hi>Whoſoever hath ſinned against me him will I blot out of my booke.</hi> chap. 33.13. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſires that <hi>God</hi> would conſider <hi>that this Nation was his people;</hi> in the 19 verſe God tells <hi>Moſes</hi> that he would proclaime his name before him, which name was <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious; ſo that this is Gods name; his power to ſhew mercy to ſuch as ſeeke him in his owne way, and to puniſh the ſtiff-necked and rebellious, even of the Iewes as well as others.</hi> But if the meaning of <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:119925:58"/>were to declare, by Gods loving <hi>Jacob</hi> and hating <hi>Eſau,</hi> that God had elected ſome men to eternall life, and reprobated others to eternall death, without relation either to good or evill in them, and that this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ariſeth from thence, <hi>Is there unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe with God?</hi> then I would faine know what ſatisfaction <hi>Paul</hi> gives in his anſwer, <hi>God forbid; for he ſaith, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, &amp;c.</hi> The objection is, whether God be not unrighteous in ſo doing? The anſwer is, No; for he ſaith he will ſo doe. <hi>It was as well proved before, in ſhewing that God did it, as it was after, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ſaid he would doe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 16. verſe, hee ſums up what he had ſpoken, in this concluſion, <hi>ſo then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy;</hi> (that is) though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did, and I doe deſire your ſalvation, and though you deſire and ſeeke ſalvation in your owne way, yet that will not effect it, for <hi>for it is not of him that willeth,</hi> and though you labour never ſo much to eſtabliſh your owne righteouſneſſe that will not doe, <hi>for it is not of him that runneth, but it is of him that is mercifull, even of God;</hi> and therefore you
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119925:58"/>muſt ſeeke after the righteouſneſſe of God which is by faith: then Paul proceeds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to manifeſt and demonſtrate the truth of what he had ſpoken, <hi>for the Scripture ſaith unto</hi> Pharoah, <hi>even for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my name might bee declared throughout all the earth,</hi> Verſe 17. In theſe words wee may conſider, firſt, the end propounded; Gods ſhewing of his power, and the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Name throughout all the Earth; then, the way and meanes by which hee brought this to paſſe, hee raiſed up <hi>Pharoah,</hi> God would manifeſt his power and name to all the world, that there was none like unto him in all the earth, ſo great and ſo mighty a God, that hee would deſtroy all ſuch as did deſpiſe and harden their hearts againſt him, though hee might beare long with them, therefore God raiſed up <hi>Pharoah</hi> a wicked man, one that he knew would har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his heart againſt him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.19 and brings plague after plague upon him, and then at laſt when no meanes would prevaile with him, he cuts him off, and this hee did that all men ſhould take notice of his power and feare his great name, and not deſpiſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119925:59"/>and harden their hearts againſt his word, leaſt he deſtroy them in like manner, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.26. and ſeeing <hi>God</hi> would have this thing taken notice of <hi>throughout all the Earth; Paul</hi> concludes that hee would have the Jewes take notice of it aſwell as others, that if they hardened their hearts againſt him, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhould be deſtroyed, though they were the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but if <hi>God</hi> did neceſsitate Pharaoh by an inevitable power or providence to doe what hee did, then hee would declare himſelfe to all the world by ſuch a name as this, <hi>that hee was a God that did harden the hearts of mente doe evill, and then puniſh them for ſo doing,</hi> but this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unſuitable to what God profeſſeth of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Then in the 18. <hi>verſe,</hi> Paul drawes this concluſion, therefore hath hee mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom hee will hee hardeneth; (that is) therefore it is manifeſt by what hath been ſaid that thoſe that feare him and ſeeke him in his owne way as he ſhould be ſought, ſhall find mercy: but thoſe that follow their own wayes, and reſiſt him, ſhall be hardened and periſh, bee they Jewes or Gentiles. (As concerning
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119925:59"/>the manner of Gods hardening I ſhall declare that in another place.)</p>
            <p>Then he makes another Objection, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>Thou wilt then, or therefore ſay unto me, why doth he yet find fault, for who hath reſiſtea his will?</hi> (that is) let it be granted, <hi>that God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and that whom hee will he hardeneth,</hi> why doth he yet complain of us, for he hath made his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with us, and his promiſes belong to us, we being <hi>Abrahams ſeed,</hi> and he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us <hi>Carcumciſion,</hi> and other Ordinances to be obſerved by us, and therefore in reſting herein for life, we doe not reſiſt his will, this <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers in the 20, 21. <hi>verſes, &amp;c. Nay, but O man who art thou that replieſt againſt God?</hi> as if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have ſaid, doeſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me, who it is that doth reſiſt the will of God, doe but conſider who thou art that doeſt make the queſtion, and thou haſt anſwered thy ſelfe; thou that doeſt labour to eſtabliſh thine owne righteouſneſſe and doſt reſt in the Law, when the law it ſelf condemnes thee, thou doſt reſiſt the will of God, for doth or ſhall the formed ſay to the forming, why haſt thou made me thus? hath not the Potter power over the Clay,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119925:60"/>of the ſame lump to make one Veſſell to honour and another to diſhonour, yet you will not allow me to doe with you as the Potter with the Clay, to deſtroy ſuch of you as goe about to eſtabliſh your owne righteouſneſſe, and oppoſe the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that I have ordained, and therein you ſtrive with, and reſiſt your Maker, though it be a ſinfull and a woefull thing for you ſo to do, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.9. and this is plainely illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.1. &amp;c. to the eleventh <hi>verſ.</hi> unto which place the Apoſtle hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, The word which came to <hi>Ieremy</hi> from the Lord, ſaying, ariſe and goe down to the Potters houſe, and there I will cauſe thee to hear my words: then I went down to the Potters Houſe, and behold hee wrought a worke on the Wheeles, and the Veſſell that he made of clay was marred in the hands of the Potter, ſo he made it again another Veſſell as ſeemed good to the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make it: Then the word of the Lord came unto me, ſaying, O Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cannot I doe with you as this Potter, ſaith the Lord? behold, as the clay is in the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hand, ſo are yee in mine hand O Houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119925:60"/>a Nation, and concerning a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to pluck up, and to pull downe, and to deſtroy it, if that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turne from their evill, I will repent of the evill I thought to doe unto them; and at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation and concerning a Kingdome to build and to plant it, if it do evill in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then will I repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit it.</p>
            <p>In which words we may ſee that God pleads for no other Power or Prerogative over the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then the Potter doth exerciſe over the clay; That vvhen a Veſſell is marred in his hand, he makes it again another Veſſell, as ſeems good unto him: So vvhen God ſpeaks concerning a Nation, or concerning a Kingdom, to build and to plant it, if it doe evill in his ſight, he may repent him of the good vvherewith he ſaid he would benefit them: So that if the Houſe of Iſrael ſeek not after his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but labour to eſtabliſh their owne, then he may deſtroy them notwithſtanding all the promiſes he hath made unto them, For he is not ſo bound by any promiſe that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119925:61"/>he hath made, but he is at liberty to puniſh thoſe that rebell and doe vvickedly, as on the contrary his threatning to inflict judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on a people, hinders him not from ſhewing mercie to the penitent, as yet forty daies and <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, where though no condition be expreſt, yet this condition vvas implyed it they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: and vvhoſoever pleads againſt this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vvhat pretence ſoever, pleads againſt the vvill and counſell of God, for vvhat if God vvilling (ſaith the Apoſtle) to ſhew his vvrath and make his power known, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured with much long ſuffering the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath fitted or made up to deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and that he might make knowne the riches of his glory on the Veſſells of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory, even us whom he hath called, not of the Jewes onely, but alſo of the Gentiles, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22, 23, 24. That is, if God will manifeſt his power and wrath on ſuch as do not believe, be they Jevves or Gentiles, vvho are fitted for deſtruction by their vvickednes, in abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the goodnes and patience of God towards them, and the riches of his mercy on ſuch as believe, who art thou that thou
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119925:61"/>ſhouldeſt reſiſt the vvill of God.</p>
            <p>But whereas it is conceived by ſome, that God doth make ſome men of purpoſe to damne and to deſtroy them and ſo hardens them that they may bee fitted for him to ſhew his wrath towards them, and all meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his will, without conſideration of any evill in them; as this is very contrary to <hi>God</hi> and the goſpel, as is elſewhere manifeſted ſo it cannot be the meaning of this place; for when the queſtion is made to <hi>Paul, why doth, he yet complaine, for who hath reſiſted his will:</hi> if he mean ſuch a will as this, that God doth make or raiſe up ſome men, whom meerely of his will hee hardens, and others whom meerly of his wil he ſoftens; then <hi>Paul</hi> doth not anſwer to the queſtion he himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, for his anſwer proves nothing but what is granted in the Objection, yea, it is the ground of the Objection, for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, <hi>why doth God complaine,</hi> the ground of it is, <hi>ſeeing he doth whatever he will, hee har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and ſoftens whom he pleaſeth: Paul</hi> anſwers that God may doe with men what he will, as the potter with the clay; but though he may, &amp; doth do what he will, yet the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction remains ſtill, why doth he then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119925:62"/>of what is done: <hi>for as the pot doth not ſay to the potter, why haſt thou made mee thus? ſo the potter doth not complaine of the pot which hee hath made according to his will, ſaying, why art thou thus made? for then the pottter muſt be angry with, and complain of himſelf that made it ſo:</hi> but the reaſon why God was angry with them was becauſe they ſought righteouſneſſe as it were by the workes of the Law, and not by faith, and that is given alſo as the reaſon why they did not attain to the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, as is evident in the 31, and 32. verſes of this Chapter, <hi>but</hi> Iſrael <hi>which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the Law of righteouſneſſe, hath not obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Law of righteouſnes:</hi> wherefore (not becauſe they were not elected) <hi>but becauſe they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the workes of the Law;</hi> for they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Novv let us take the advice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his 2. Epiſtle, 3. Chapter, and 15 Verſe, and <hi>account the long-ſuffering of God ſalvation, even as our beloved brother</hi> Paul <hi>alſo in all his Epiſtles</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hath Written unto you according to the Wiſdome given unto him; and though ſome things</hi> in Pauls Epiſtles (as in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularin this Chapt.) be difficult and hard
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119925:62"/>to be underſtood, yet let us be carefull that we do not make the patience or forbearance of God deſtruction to any man, <hi>for bee is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> as it is in the 9 verſe of the forementioned Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.39.40. therefore could they not believe, becauſe <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſaid againe hee hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor underſtand with their heart and be converted and I ſhould heale them; hence it is inferred that as God affords ſome men meanes ſufficient to beget faith in them, ſo he blinds the eyes, and hardens the hearts of others that they cannot believe.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, firſt where it is ſaid they could not believe, and that God blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, that they ſhould not believe, neither of theſe expreſsions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies any naturall inability or want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in them to believe; onely it declares that what God fore ſaw, and by his Prophet foretold, could not but bee fulfilled: For could, would, and ſhould, are ſignes of one and the ſame moode; and where it is read that they ſhould not, &amp;c. it may be as truly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119925:63"/>and more properly be read, that they would not. And therefore wee may obſerve, that theſe very perſons are exhorted to believe, in the 36 verſe, and in the 37 verſe, Chriſt complains that though he had done ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miracles before them yet they believed not on him; but if God had hardned their hearts that they could not believe, Chriſt vvould not have admired at their unbeliefe, and there were no emphaſis in Chriſts doing <hi>ſo many miracles before them,</hi> for if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were ſuch that though many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were done before them, they could not believe, then one miracle had bin as propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable a meanes to worke faith in them as many; and where Chriſt did one miracle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, if hee had done a thouſand, and withall <hi>ſo blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts, that they could not believe,</hi> their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe had bin no more ſtrange, nor no more to bee complained of, then if hee had done nothing. And for the meaning of the place I conceive it to be none other then this that God fore-ſeeing and by his Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling the unbeliefe and blindneſſe of the Jews notwithſtanding all the meanes which God had afforded them, it could not be but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119925:63"/>the Scripture and word of God muſt bee fulfilled, as was formerly expreſt, and in that ſence they could not believe, as Judas could not, but betray his maſter, and as the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could not but <hi>part the garments of Chriſt, caſt lots for his Veſture, and pierce his hands and his feet, and the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is ſaid they could not believe becauſe God had blinded their eyes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God doth not poſsitively blind the eyes, nor harden the hearts of any: <hi>God</hi> doth not incline nor diſpoſe any mans heart to hardneſſe, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaks in the like caſe, <hi>let no man ſay when hee is tempted to evill, that he is tempted of God,</hi> James 1.13. ſo let no man ſay when he is hardned in evill, that hee is hardened of God, <hi>for God in ſo doing ſhould bee contrary to himſelfe;</hi> and it is proper to the Devill to blind the eyes, and harden the hearts of men againſt the truth, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>that by manifeſting the truth they ſo commended themſelves to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God, that if their goſpel were hid, it was hid to thoſe that periſh, in whom the God of this World hath blinded the eyes of them that believe not; leſt the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious goſpel of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who is the Image of

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119925:64"/>ſaid to cloze and blind their owne eyes; as <hi>Matthew</hi> records the words of Chriſt, and it muſt bee in ſuch a ſenſe as is ſuitable to God and the goſpel: The queſtion then is, how God is ſaid to blind their eyes, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their hearts, and how they are ſaid, to blind their owne eyes? which I conceive to bee in this ſenſe; God blinds their eyes and hardens their hearts accidentally; the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell which was intended of God for life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſtumbling to them, their table a ſnare, and that which ſhould have been for their good, a trap, ſo that they fall and are broken, and periſh. But they harden their owne hearts poſsitively, directly, willingly, and wilfully; ſo that this makes nothing to prove mens inability to believe the goſpel when it is declared to them, but only ſhewes that the goſpel which naturally leads men to repentance, to thankfulneſſe, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God, doth accidentally through mens wilfulneſſe and ſtubbornnes produce a contrary effect; and ſo whereas if they did bring forth fruit anſwerable to the meanes, they ſhould receive a bleſsing from God, they bringing forth thorns are rejected nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to bee burned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6, 7 8.</p>

The ſecond thing implyed is, that if Chriſt had ſpoken the things of God plainly, and not in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; it was poſsible (if not probable) that they had ſeene, underſtood, been converted, and ſo have had their ſinnes forgiven them; now this would prove an ability in men to ſee, underſtand, and bee converted; when the things of God are declared plainely to them, which doctrine thoſe that urge this Scripture (to prove that God ſpeaks to ſome men that they may not bee converted) will
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119925:65"/>by no meanes allow; though indeed it be a fooliſh thing to conceive that God did ſpeak to thoſe men in parables, <hi>lest they ſhould ſee and underſtand,</hi> which were ſo blind that they could not ſee nor underſtand, though hee had ſpoken never ſo plainly; but the words may be thus read or rendred, to them which are without, all theſe things are done in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, that ſeeing may ſee and cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and hearing may heare and cannot (that is, will not) underſtand; leſt at any time they ſhould bee converted, and their ſinnes ſhould bee forgiven them: and this manner of ſpeaking is often times uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; for inſtance, when a Maſter cals upon his Servant, and his Servant neglects to anſwer him, or come to him, the Maſter expreſſeth himſelfe by way of reproofe in this manner; Cannot you heare? cannot you anſwer? cannot you come when you are called? implying that hee is able, and ought to come, and therefore is worthy of reproofe in that hee demeanes himſelfe like one that is unable, that cannot come: ſo we ſay of him that neglects ſome opportunity of doing himſelfe good, if hee cannot make uſe of an opportunity when he hath it, it is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119925:66"/>no matter though he miſſe what he deſires:</p>
            <p>Now when we ſay if he cannot, our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, if he may or can, and do not, or will not; ſo theſe words [that ſeeing, may ſee, and cannot perceive, and hearing may hear and cannot underſtand, leaſt at any time they ſhould be converted and their ſins ſhould be forgiven them,] are ſpoken by way of reproof of the Jewes, and are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the reaſon of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſpeaking to them in Parrables, and not as his end in ſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For the things by vvhich they might have been converted and their ſins forgiven them, were ſpoken to them plainly: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might ſee and did not, and might hear and did not: therefore Chriſt vvould not diſcover thoſe further miſeries of the Kingdome vvhich were proper and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to them which had already believed in him. And that this is the meaning of the place, appeares more plainly, if you conſider <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11, 12.13. where the ſame Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being recorded, the reaſon is given by Chriſt to his Apoſtles, why he thus ſpake to the unbelieving Jewes in Parrables, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had not improved the light al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcovered to them, [for whoſoever

            <p>Againe, it is objected from certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Exodus, viz.</hi> I will harden <hi>Pharaoh, chap.</hi> 7.3. But <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhall not hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. And the Lord hardned the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that he hearkened not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.12. From thoſe and the like places men do conclude that God doth poſitively harden the hearts of ſome, ſo that they cannot believe and obey the truth, for (ſay they) God was ſo farre from enabling <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to do what he required of him, that (on the contrary) he hardned his heart that he might not do it.</p>
            <p>For anſwer whereunto, conſider (that as God tempts no man to ſin, ſo much leſſe doth he harden any man in ſin. Againe, where it is ſaid, I will harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart <hi>chap.</hi> 7.3. But <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhall not hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. It may as truly and more properly be read, And I ſhall hearden <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachs</hi> heart. But he will not hearken unto you, for <hi>ſhall</hi> and <hi>will</hi> (in this place) are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignes of the Future Tence, ſerving to expreſſe ſomwhat to come. For God did not exerciſe any coercive power upon <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> that kept him from hearkening to his word, or from letting the people goe; but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119925:68"/>only did declare what effect the meanes which God intended to uſe with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would take upon him, even to harden his heart, though the means uſed did properly and naturally tend to ſoften it; and ſo God might be ſaid to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did that for (or before) him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he knew <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would take occaſion to harden his owne heart, as appeares in this, that when <hi>God</hi> ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him to let the people goe, God tells <hi>Moſes</hi> that he was ſure that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not let them goe, but by a mighty hand, God knew that inſtead of obeying his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he would be hardened by it, and yet bids <hi>Moſes</hi> to goe and doe the Meſſage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> How can this agree with that love and goodneſſe in God which hath bin pleaded for: for if God doe that which he knowes will indirectly or by accident make us worſe and harden us, he might with as much love and goodnes directly doe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The caſe is farre different, for if God had poſitively or directly hardened <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, then ſo farre <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had been without fault, becauſe God did it, and he could not help it, and for God to have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119925:68"/>hardened him in this ſence, and then to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him for his hardnes, was inconſiſtent with the juſtice and goodnes of God.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>God</hi> do that which is juſt and good (which properly and naturally leads men to do the like) is his goodneſſe ever the leſſe, or ſhould he forbeare to doe good, becauſe he ſees that men will abuſe his goodneſſe, then God muſt not act like God, when men will not act like men, but muſt goe out of his way, and doe things unlike himſelf, or ceaſe to do what is ſuteable and agreeable to his excellent nature, to comply with their wickedneſſe and ſtubborneſſe and ſo inſtead of converting evill men, and making them like himſelf, he himſelf would become like to them.</p>
            <p>But let us a little further conſider what is here done to <hi>Pharaoh; Pharaoh</hi> doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, afflict and grieve the people of God, and their cry and their groaning (by reaſon of their bondage) came up unto God, and God had a reſpect unto them, and reſolves to deliver them out of the hand of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and to bring them into a good and large Land, flowing with Milke and Honey, according to his Covenant and promiſe.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119925:69"/>Now God ſends <hi>Moſes</hi> to Pharaoh, to deſire him to let the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> goe three dayes journey into the wilderneſſe to worſhip; yet God knew that he ſhould har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Pharaohs heart thereby, or that Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh would harden his heart thereupon, which is all one, ſhould God have ſuffered his people to remaine in ſlavery and ſorrow under their Task-maſters and not have ſent to tell Pharaoh of it, becauſe he knew hee would not hearken, but be hardened.</p>
            <p>Againe, when <hi>Moſes</hi> had delivered his meſſage to Pharaoh, and received that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere from him, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his voice, and let Iſrael goe? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Iſrael goe:</hi> ſhould God now have leſt Pharaoh, and not by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles have manifeſted himſelfe to be the Lord, becauſe he knew Pharaoh would be hardened, and not ſet his heart to conſider it; or when the judgement did ſoften Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs heart, and he deſires a removall of it, promiſing to let Iſrael goe, ſhould God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſhew mercy to him on his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, knowing that he would be hardened upon the receipt of it; ſhould God ceaſe to bee, or doe good, becauſe Pharaoh
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119925:69"/>would abuſe his goodneſſe, and thereby take occaſion or liberty to doe evill, then God could not manifeſt to the ſonnes of men the riches of his goodneſſe and mercy, his readineſſe to pardon, &amp;c. Moreover, if we take notice of the hiſtory we ſhall finde by divers paſſages that Pharaoh was free in what he did, and that God did not harden him in any evill (otherwiſe then hath been declared) nor hinder him from any good: For when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes to Pharaoh of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Frogges from him and his houſes, he declares this to be the end and reaſon thereof, <hi>That Pharaoh might know that there was none like to the Lord their God,</hi> chap. 8.10. yet in the 15 verſe we finde a contrary effect, together with the ground and riſe of it: the effect was, that <hi>Pharaoh hardened his heart, and harkened not unto them, as the Lord had ſaid,</hi> or foretold; the riſe and ground of it was, he ſaw there was reſpite, the judgement was over, and he in ſtead of turning the grace and goodneſſe of God into thankfulneſſe and obedience, turnes it into deceitfulneſſe and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, when <hi>Moſes</hi> promiſeth Pharaoh
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119925:70"/>to entreat the Lord that the ſwarmes of flyes might depart from him, his ſervants, and from his people: He charges Pharaoh that he ſhould not deale deceitfully any more, in not letting the people goe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto the Lord, verſ. 29. but if Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh had beene ſo hardened by the Lord, that hee could not hearken and let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple goe, he had not dealt deceitfully, but on the contrary, the deceit had been in God (according to this doctrine) in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pharaoh upon a great penalty to let the people goe, and yet to harden his heart that he could not let them goe: but we may find verſ. 32. that Pharaoh hardened his heart at that time alſo, neither would he let the people goe.</p>
            <p>Againe, when the thundring and haile ceaſed, Pharaoh ſinned yet more, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his heart, and would not let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple goe: Why? he ſaw the judgement was paſt, and in ſtead of being thankfull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he is more ſtubborne, chap. 9. 34, 35. and yet chap. 10.1. God is ſaid to have har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened Pharaohs heart in that particular; whereby it is further evident that God is ſaid to harden him, in that ſenſe onely
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119925:70"/>which is already manifeſted. God is ſaid to raiſe up Pharaoh of purpoſe to ſhew his power in him, and that his name might be declared throughout all the earth chap. 9. 16. and to harden him, that he might ſhew his ſignes before him, chap. 10. 1. therefore ſeeing God declares his end in hardening Pharaoh, he ownes the act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auſ.</hi> Let us a little conſider the places for the firſt, chap 9.16. if we read what goes before, and what followes, we may ſee that God did not raiſe up <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to ſhew his power, or to declare his name in his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as Pharaoh was a man, but as he was a wicked proud, ſtubborn, ſtiffe-necked, and rebellious man: for verſ. the 14. he ſaith, <hi>For I will at this time ſend all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy ſervants, and upon thy people,</hi> to what end, to harden him? no, but that he might know that there was none like God in all the earth. And in the 17. verſe, he ſaith, <hi>As yet exaltest thou thy ſelfe against my people, and wilt not let them goe:</hi> but if God had hardned him in that ſence, which ſome men conceive; it could not then be ſaid to Pharaoh, that he exalted himſelfe againſt God, but that God had
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119925:71"/>exalted Pharaoh againſt himſelfe. But the meaning of it I conceive to be this. God foreſeeing that Pharaoh would be a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and rebellious man, one that would exalt himſelfe againſt him, after many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and judgements, and much means to humble him, raiſed him up of purpoſe the being a man for the purpoſe) to ſhew his power, and declare his name in his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that others might take notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and not rebell againſt God as Pharaoh did, leſt they were plagued and puniſhed as hee was. And accordingly the Prieſts and Diviners of the Philiſtims, <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6. when the judgement of God was upon the people for retaining the Arke, exhorted them to ſend it away in theſe words; <hi>Why doe you harden your hearts, as the Egiptians, and Pharaoh hardened their hearts, when he had wrought wonderfully amongſt them; did they not let the people goe, and they departed?</hi> whereby we perceive that they better underſtood the meaning of God in his dealing with Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, and made better uſe of it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then moſt in our dayes doe: whereas if Pharaohs hardneſſe had been wrought in him by God, his deſtruction for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119925:71"/>of his heart had beene very unfit for God, thereby to manifeſt his power and name to all the world; unleſſe hee would have them to take knowledge of him to bee a God that made men finne, and then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them for it: for that Chapter 10.1. it agrees with the former place, and as I conceive is thus to bee underſtood: God willing to declare to <hi>Phoraoh</hi> and to all the World (by his ſignes and miracles) that hee was a great and mighty God, and that there was no reſiſting of him; and that he would puniſh ſuch as did abuſe his grace, and turn it into wantonneſſe, and ſtubbornneſſe; did take occaſion upon his fore-knowledge of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> wickedneſſe and deceitfullneſſe to manifeſt the ſame in him: for in the 9 chap. 27, 28. verſes, wee find <hi>Pharaohs</hi> repentance for refuſing to let the people goe; and hee ſaid unto them, <hi>I have ſinned this time, the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked; intreat the Lord, (for it is enough) that there bee no more mighty Thunderings and Haile; and I will let the people goe, and yee ſhall stay nolonger:</hi> Now this repentance of <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall (though afterwards he dealt deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hardened his heart) and God who is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119925:72"/>rich in mercy, ready to pardon and forgive upon repentance and ſubmiſsion, did cauſe the Thundering and Haile to ceaſe; now God may be ſaid from one conſideration, to remove the Judgment from <hi>Pharooh</hi> and his people to ſave them, and yet from another conſideration he may be ſaid to remove the ſame judgement, to the end he may deſtroy them; for when God ſpeakes of intending the good and ſalvation of ſuch men as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the meanes and mercies he beſtowes on them, hee declares that end which the means doth properly and naturally lead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but when hee ſpeakes of intending the puniſhment, evill, or ruine of men, in the meanes and mercies hee beſtowes on them, then hee ſpeakes in reference to their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, refuſing, or abuſing thereof.</p>
            <p>Now this latter is not his proper and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate end, conſidering what the perſon is when he beſtowes theſe mercies and means on him: but it is his end in reference to what the perſon will bee, or doe, upon the receite of the mercies and meanes, being grounded upon his foreknowledge of their wickedneſſe and perverſneſſe, and ſomwhat in the like ſence Chriſt ſpeaks when he ſaith
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119925:72"/>
               <hi>he came not to bring peace but the ſword;</hi> and ſo <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaith of Chriſt <hi>that hee was ſet for the fall of many in Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall now ſpeake ſomewhat of thoſe Scriptures which are urged to prove, that God in the publication of the goſpel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held that meanes from ſome men, without which they could not believe: and firſt I ſhall begin with that which is written <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>all the Father giveth me ſhall come to mee,</hi> &amp;c. hence it is inferred, that God looking upon the lumpe of loſt men choſe out ſome of them, and gave them to Chriſt, leaving the reſt meerely of his will, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their imbracing or rejecting the goſpel; and thoſe thus given he by a ſpeciall and allmighty power cauſeth to come, which power being not exerciſed toward the reſt of the Sonnes of men, they cannot come to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider that this word <hi>ſhall</hi> in this place, doth not ſignifie any power or com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulſion exerciſed by God, to cauſe theſe men to come to him, but is meerely a ſigne of the Future Tenſe, and may as well bee read, will come to me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I deny that God doth put any
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119925:73"/>ſuch difference between the ſons of men in unbeliefe, (but of this in another place.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſcope of the place carries it another way, for in the 26 verſe Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves thoſe perſons, for that their end in ſeeking of him was low, baſe and ſiniſter. In the 27 verſ. he exhorts them firſt negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to labour for the meat which periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; then affirmatively, but for that meate which endureth to everlaſting life, which ſaith he, the Sonne of man ſhall give unto you, you unbelievers which ſeeke me for the loaves, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. which did ſee, and yet did not believe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36 which did murmure at Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. unto you will I give that meat which doth endure to eternall life, for to that end am I ſent and ſealed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and this meat or bread was his Fleſh, which hee was to give for the life of the World, <hi>verſ.</hi> 51. In the 28 verſe. the Jewes demand of him what they ſhould do to work the workes of God, that ſo they might bee partakers of that meat, which he was ſealed of the Father to give unto them? Chriſt tels them that they were to believe on him whom God had ſent, verſ 29 they pretend a willingneſſe to believe, if they ſaw any
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119925:73"/>ground or foundation for their faith; and therefore they ſay unto him <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. what ſign ſheweſt thou, that we may ſee &amp; believe what doſt thouwork? <hi>Moſes</hi> manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bee of God, for hee gave our Fathers bread from Heaven, verſ. 31. but what doſt thou? Chriſt tells them in the 32. 33. verſ. that <hi>Moſis</hi> did not give them that bread from heaven, but ſaith he, <hi>my Father doth give you the true bread from heaven, for the bread of God is he which commeth down from heaven, and giveth liſe unto the world.</hi> The Jews then deſire to have that bread given them evermore, verſ. 34. Chriſt tells them that he was the <hi>bread of life,</hi> and if they did come to him they ſhould never hunger; and if they did beleeve on him they ſhould never thirſt: but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>whereas yee pretend that if yee did ſee, yee would believe, you alſo have ſeen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not, verſ.</hi> 35, 36. Then Chriſt proceeds further, verſ. 37. and tels them that all that the Father giveth him, (that is, to give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life unto which the Jewes deſired, ver. 34.) will come to him, and him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hee will in no 'wiſe caſt out: for hee came not down from heaven to do his own will, but his Fathers; and this is his Fathers
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119925:74"/>will, that of all that hee had given him, hee ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at the laſt day, and that every one that ſee'ch the Son, and believeth on him, ſhould have everlaſting life, verſ. 40. but ſeeing ye have ſeene and believe not, the bread of life which you deſire, belongs not to you; you are not of thoſe which the Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or commended to me to that end: I have no commiſsion from the Father, to beſtow life upon you but only to ſuch as come unto me, as believe on mee: and this I conceive to be the meaning of this place, <hi>all that the Father giveth me, will come to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is one Objection needfull to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, to take off a ſeeming contradiction which ſome may apprehend from what hath bin ſaid <hi>(viz.)</hi> that in opening of the 27 verſ. I ſay that Chriſt was appointed of the Father, to give eternall life to thoſe which believe not; and in opening the 37 verſ. I ſay, Chriſt was appointed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give life only to thoſe which ſhould believe.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, that God gives all men eternall life in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. or he gives Chriſt a ſufficient meanes to bring
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119925:74"/>all men to life; Chriſt by his death hath purchaſed life for every man &amp; he declares this in the goſpel to the Sonnes of men, now thoſe that will not believe it, receive it nor live to it, in the day of grace and mercy, (which is all that God requires) ut is not his will that they ſhould partake of it, at the laſt day, the day of Judgement.</p>
            <p>Againe, Joh. 6.43, 44. <hi>murmure not among your ſelves, for no man can come to mee, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him:</hi> whence it is inferred, that the reaſon why thoſe murmuring Jewes did not come to Chriſt, was, becauſe they could not, that meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wanting which cauſed others to come; For the opening of this Scripture, conſider that this word <hi>draw,</hi> hath an equivocall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, ſome times we are ſaid to draw, when wee uſe meanes to remove a thing though it be not moved by the means; ſome times we are ſaid not to have drawen, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the meanes, vvhen the means ſo uſed doth not take effect; as thus; we ſay I have drawne ſuch a man, but hee will not come, and yet of the ſame perſon, wee ſay vve cannot draw him; in like manner wee ſay, I have perſwaded ſuch a man, and yet
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119925:75"/>vve ſay of the ſame man (when our perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions take not effect) that I cannot perſwade him, ſo that he is perſwaded, and yet he is not perſwaded, hee is drawne, and yet hee is not drawne; therefore wee muſt conſider hovv the drawing of the Father is to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in this place, whether thus, <hi>none can come to me, except the Father uſe meanes to draw him;</hi> or thus, <hi>none can come to mee, except the means uſed by the father prevaile with him.</hi> Now both theſe are true, but the firſt is not to be underſtood in this place; for the Argument of the place, is, that thoſe that are ſo drawn by the Father, as the place intends, doe all come. Novv all that the Father doth uſe meanes to dravv, doe not come, for ſome dravv backe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39. ſome reſiſt and oppoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. and God having raiſed up Chriſt, ſent him to bleſſe the <hi>Iows</hi> in turning every one of them from their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities, though few were turned, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26. and God leaves the very Heathen without excuſe in reſpect of meanes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. therefore it muſt bee underſtood in this place, according to the latter acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>none can come to mee, except the meanes uſed by the Father prevaile with them:</hi> and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119925:75"/>more plainely, if you conſider the 45 verſe. <hi>Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, commeth unto me;</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewing, that no man is drawn according to the intent of the ſpirit of God, in this place; but ſuch a one as hath heard and learned of the Father, and that every one ſo drawn doth come.</p>
            <p>For God the Father declares, that there is peace, reconciliation, remiſsion of ſinnes, and eternall life in his Son for all men, and thereupon invites and perſwades them to come to the ſon to believe, to heare, to obey, to follow the Sonne in whom this fullneſſe is, that ſo they may be partakers of it; and if they do not believe in him, they ſhall die in their ſinnes. Now if men believe GOD, that there is ſuch ſafety and ſecurity, ſuch fullneſſe of bleſſedneſſe in his Sonne then doe they immediately cloze with him, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and obſerve him in all things; and this I conceive to bee the meaning of this place, <hi>none can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him;</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure not concerning my Father and mother, for except the word, teſtimony, and witneſſe of God prevaile with you, you will not, you cannot come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me?</hi>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119925:76"/>ſaid not to be done not to be given; as when we are demanded whether wee have given ſuch a man ſuch a thing, we anſwer (when the thing is refuſed) no he will not receive it, and ſo it is not given in the effect, though wee did as much (in reſpect of the act done by us) as if it had been received; and there are other Scriptures like this, which muſt receive the ſame Anſwer, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee unto this day, (that is) they had not a heart to perceive, eyes to ſee, and eares to heare,</hi> notwithſtanding all the meanes which God uſed with them to that end: for <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 2, 3.4, 5. &amp; 6. verſes, reaſons thus with them, yee have ſeene all that the Lord did before your eyes in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and to all his ſervants, and unto all his Land; the great temptations which thine eyes have ſeene, and ſignes, and thoſe great miracles: having lead you forty yeeres in the <hi>Wildernes,</hi> your clothes waxed not old upon you, neither did your ſhooes waxe old upon your feet; he preſerved you in ſtrength and health, without the ordinary mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119925:77"/>that he was the Lord your God, as is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the latter end of the 6 verſe.

               <hi>God</hi> had given, but here they are blamed from this reaſon, that God had not given it, yet God hath not given you an heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now no blame can be faſtened on them, for not having a heart, from ſuch a reaſon that God had not given it to them (there being no other way to obtaine it) though it had been given them in <hi>Adam.</hi> Againe, if this 4. verſ. ſhould bee taken as a declaration of what God had not done for them in reſpect of himſelf; as the former verſes are of what hee had done, then it takes away all the life and vertue of the Argument of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the place, for hee endeavours to ſet forth the goodneſſe of God toward the Jewes, in the great meanes which he had afforded them, to cauſe them to know him to bee the Lord their God; but the 4. verſe, according to this latter acceptation he makes all nothing, yea worſe then nothing; for then <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes after this manner, <hi>God hath done much for you, but hee hath not given you that without which all that hee hath done can doe you no good, without which all his mercies and meanes, will but aggravate and inercaſe your woe and miſery:</hi> and this would be no apt argument to perſwade the people to enter into further Covenant

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119925:82"/>our greatneſſe in the things of this life, is vaine and fooliſh: the ſpirit of the world perſwades us to cleave to the world to ſeek after the things thereof, perſwading us that it is a vaine thing to neglect and forſake things preſent, which we ſee, to ſeeke and embrace things which doe not appeare; ſo that the naturall man cannot know (that is) cannot approve of the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, for they are to be judged and diſcerned onely by faith, by that ſpirit which he hath not received, which dwells not in him, which is contrary to him: not but that a naturall man may reject and caſt off the ſpirit of this World, and ſo receive the things of the Spirit of God; for we are all naturall untill we receive the things of the Spirit of God; but he doth not receive them, he cannot know them, that is, whilſt he is naturall, whileſt he retaines, hearkens unto and followes the dictates and ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpirit of this world. The intent of the Apoſtle in this place is only to ſhew how contrary, how incompatible the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God and the ſpirit of the World are, how they cannot lodge under one roofe, they are like God and Mammon, <hi>hee that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119925:82"/>loves the one must hate the other, he that cleaves to the one muſt deſpiſe the other,</hi> and this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is all that is intended in this place.</p>
            <p>Thus have I briefly declared what I conceive to be the meaning of theſe hard places of Scripture.</p>

When <hi>John</hi> deſcribes the Divine Nature to bee Love, he declares this as the moſt eminent manifeſtation thereof, the giving his Sonne to death, that we might live through him; therefore it is of excellent uſe and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the ſonnes of men be rooted and grounded in the fulneſſe of the glory of this truth, of the full, free, univerſall, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall Love of God towards them in Chriſt, for that will fill their hearts with love to God. The apprehenſion of his love
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119925:84"/>begets love in us; we love him, becauſe he loved us firſt: and the reaſon why ſo few men love God, is becauſe ſo few men know him to be Love; and thoſe that have ſome affection and love to God, if they ſaw more of his love would love him more, and bee more eſtabliſht in his love; they would not be ſo toſſed too and fro with every wind of temptation, for they might <hi>quench all the fiery darts of Sathan</hi> (the grand enemy of their peace and comfort) with this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>God is Love.</hi> Love affords us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent argument to prevail with our hearts, to truſt God in every ſtrait, and to cloze with him in every promiſe: what can hee deny us that ſpared not his Sonne, but gave him to death for us? The apprehenſion of this love will fill us with joy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all conditions; it will make us to doe and ſuffer with delight: Love makes us one with God, it quickneth and enlargeth us adding fulneſſe and perfection to all our ſervices, making us fervent in Spirit, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord: but where there is little love, there is little life in what is done, for love is the ſoule, love is the ſubſtance of Religion; Knowledge puffes up, Love
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119925:84"/>builds up, knowledge makes a man ſeem to bee, but love makes a man to be indeed; for he that is full of Love, is full of God, for <hi>God</hi> is Love, hee is the fountaine and Father of Love; love will teach us to deny all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and worldly luſts, and to live righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and holily in this preſent world; for love will doe nothing unpleaſing to the thing it loves.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſeeing this truth is ſo excellent, how ſhould we labour to preſerve it, in its fullneſſe, beauty, and glory; it is the ground and foundation of all our hopes; it is our life, all our ſprings are in it, and all our expectation from it, it is the truth of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>God</hi> of truth, for <hi>God</hi> is love. Now conſidering what excellent effects this truth would produce, were it knowne, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced among the ſons of Men; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſidering, what ſtrange, dark and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall doctrines are preached and publiſhed by thoſe, which profeſſe themſelves Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the goſpel, and grace of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yea by the moſt zealous of them; as, that <hi>God</hi> did from eternity decree the ruine, and damnation of the moſt part of men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to any evil, which he knew they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119925:85"/>would commit: <hi>or (as the more moderate) that he hath left the moſt part of men, being fallen in irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable condition. That God calls upon men to do that which they are unable to perform, and yet damns them in hell fire for not performance. That God calls, invites, and perſwades men by his miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to believe that they may have life, and yet hath no life for them, nor intention that they ſhould live;</hi> that the end of God in ſending meanes, and beſtowing mercies on the moſt part of the Sonnes of men, is onely to harden them, to make them veſſells of wrath, to fit them for deſtruction. Theſe things I ſay cauſed mee to publiſh theſe few lines of <hi>the love of God to all:</hi> for 'its impoſsible that men ſhould ever bee eſtabliſhed in the love of God, whiles their minds and conſciences are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with ſuch ſtrange conceits of him. The glad tydings of the Love, and grace of God in Chriſt, is plaine and eaſie to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the meaneſt capacity, and if it were delivered with plainneſſe and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city it would manifeſt it ſelf to every mans conſcience with power and efficacy. But the teachers of the people cauſe them to erre, they lead them in darke and ſad waies, they poſſeſſe them with falſe and wicked
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119925:85"/>Principles, and thereby keepe them in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, terrifying, and comforting them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the viſions of their owne heart. They have brought up another goſpel, I may ſay other goſpels, (though indeed they be no goſpels, but onely dreames and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) whereby they deceive the people, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in darkneſſe, filling the World with diſputes. They inſtead of revealing the goſpel, have hid it from the eyes of men: for no men are more reſolvedly ignorant therof then thoſe which would be thought the moſt knowne men. They are more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory in their concluſions, then ſeaven men that can render a reaſon for what they ſay, yea they deſpiſe and trample on reaſon, as low, carnall, and not to bee exerciſed in divine things; they ſpeake in a dialect that none can underſtand, but ſuch as are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, (as ſome of them will affirme) as though God would have mens affections run without or before their judgement to believe, or doe that which they cannot give a reaſon of. Thoſe that deny the univerſall love of God, are the men that thruſt out the goſpel, and bring in the Law; that throw downe Chriſt, and ſet up themſelves, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119925:86"/>ground their comfort more in their owne humiliation then in Chriſts; more in what they doe, then in what Chriſt hath done; more in their owne grace, then in the grace of God; they bound and limit the love and death of Chriſt to ſome few perſons onely, and therefore they muſt find out ſomthing to diſtinguiſh them from others, which may ſerve as a ground of their faith, that Chriſt dyed for them and not for others. Hence it is that they lay the ground and foundation of their peace and comfort in legall terrors, preparations, marks, ſignes, and qualifications: In humiliations they have bend below others, and therfore thinke they have ground to exalt themſelves above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: But whiles the ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their comfort is in themſelves, it muſt needs be uncertaine, and unſtable, as they themſelves are: when their ſpirits are compoſed, and they find themſelves well affected, they conclude they have faith, and are in the love and favour of God: It is but a little, and they are in another temper, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe diſpoſed, and then they caſt away all peace and comfort, and will by no means entertain any thoughts of the love and grace
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:119925:86"/>of God to ſuch ſinfull wretches as they are: What is this, but to put their preparations, qualifications, and diſpoſitions, in the place of Chriſt, and ſo to live and die as thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, or are withdrawne: hence it is that ſo many poore ſoules are diſtracted for want of the apprehenſion of the love and grace of God towards them in Chriſt, that ſome of them are continually toſled up and downe, one day lifted up to heaven, and another day caſt downe to hell, in their owne appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions: others continually caſt of comfort all their daies being ſo terrifi'd with horror, and amazement of ſpirit, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to God and man, of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſtroy themſelves, and others hardly eſcape: whereof we have wofull and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall experience; many ſweet and excellent ſpirits have beene poſſeſſed with thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous doctrines, which are deſtructive to the manifeſtation of the love of God unto them; it is time for men now to awake out of ſleep and to abandon theſe horrid opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and not to ſuffer themſelves to be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and led into ſuch palpable and abſurd errors; the abſurdity of them being ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that he that runs may read it, a child
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119925:87"/>may diſcover it, for to limit the love and death of Chriſt to ſome few perſons onely, and to perſwade men to peace from that doctrine, is to build without a foundation, <hi>to ſhew unto them broken Ciſternes that will hold no water:</hi> ſo that it is a marvell, that all that feare God, holding that opinion, are not in the like diſtempers and diſtractions that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, ſeeing they are taught to deny that doctrine, which is the ground of true peace and comfort, the univerſall love and grace of God in Chriſt towards mankind. I have demanded of ſome, that deny the love of God in giving Chriſt for all, how they know Chriſt dyed for them: they Anſwer, becauſe God hath perſwaded their hearts to believe, which in effect is, they believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe; but true faith clozeth immediately with God in his word, <hi>God</hi> hath ſpoken, and therefore I believe, is the voice of Faith; and not I beleeve and therefore God hath ſpoken, wee muſt not make a groundleſſe faith, the ground of our faith for then wee ſhall multiply fancies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of faith. God is love, this love is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to all the Sonnes of men, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt, that they all might live
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:119925:87"/>through him; GOD would have all men to confide in, and caſt themſelves upon, this his love and goodneſſe, and it ſhall goe well with them: The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is firme, the bed is large, if we ground our peace here, our peace vvill bee firme and ſtable, like Mount Sion, which ſhall never bee moved, like GOD himſelfe.</p>
            <p>But thoſe that teach that Chriſt dyed onely for a few, take away the true goſpel, (and ground of faith, and introduce a falſe goſpel, which affords men no ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and hence it is, that they have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed another error to maintaine the former, that men by all the meanes which was afforded in common where the goſpel was preached) could not believe. And indeed were their doctrine true, that Chriſt dyed onely for ſome; I ſhould agree with them: (For it would of neceſsity follow) that no man could believe, ſeeing God in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the goſpel, ſpake to all men in generall, but to no man in particular or by name, yet they ſay that they believe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119925:88"/>and that their faith is fixed on the word of GOD, if ſo, then there is a rationall ground for their faith in the Word of GOD, or there is not, if there bee, then it is as well every mans ground, as any mans, and as poſsible for every man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as any man if there be not, then they doe not believe, for God himſelf cannot make a man believe without ground; &amp; the things whereon they ground their peace and comfort, and wherein they glory and rejoice, (as that God perſwaded and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowred their hearts to believe ſuch a promiſe, made this or that Scripture theirs; ſpake to them in it, gave them aboundance of comfort from it, at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place, in ſuch a manner, after they had been ſo long in a deſpairing &amp; diſtracted condition in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under the Law) are vaine.</p>
            <p>For now though that Scripture or pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe be made theirs, (as they conceive) and they doe believe it (as they ſay) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves in it, that <hi>God</hi> loves them, and that they ſhall certainly live, yet can
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119925:88"/>they give no ground or reaſon (from their principles) why that Scripture or Promiſe belongs to them; much leſſe that it ſhould more belong to them then to others, onely they ſay, that God perſwaded their hearts: but if he perſwaded them, he perſwaded their underſtandings and judgements by ſome evident and rationall demonſtration or concluſion from the Scripture, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo believed, and if not, then the things they ſpeak of are but pleaſing fancies, and golden dreams.</p>
            <p>Againe from this Doctrine of limiting the love of God to a few, the love of the moſt religious men of our times is alſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to a few, to love thoſe that love them, to do good to thoſe that do good to them, to ſalute their Brethren onely, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chriſt tells them plainly, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſingular in it, they doe no more then others, then ſinners, then Publicans, whereas if God indeed were the Patterne of their love, their love would be univerſall like the love of God; love is a debt due to all men, and wee ſhall never be freed from
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119925:89"/>that debt in this World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the words of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.30. That every man we ſee in miſery or in need of our helpe and relief is our Neighbour, and wee muſt love our Neighbour as our ſelves in deed and in truth, without diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation; ſo that we ought to love all men, the evill and unthankfull our enemies thoſe that hate, curſe and perſecute us, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can beget ſuch a Spirit in us, but the Spirit of this Doctrine, of the free and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall love of God to us, when we were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſinfull loſt creatures, evill and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull. As God by the diſcovery of his love and goodneſſe to us, did turn us from evill to good, ſo ſhould we endeavour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the evill of men by good, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with them by love, for love is very powerfull; whereas mens diſpoſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting ſuch as are not ſo good as they would have them, or ſuch as ſuit not with them in judgement and opinion, makes them to be deſpiſed and hated, yea many men deſpiſe Religion it ſelf. Seeing theſe things doe appeare in thoſe which profeſſe themſelves to be moſt religious, though indeed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119925:89"/>teacheth no ſuch thing, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; as the Scriptures plainly manifeſt; the ſubſtance of Religion is almoſt loſt, and there is little elſe then the ſhew or name of it remaining: <hi>(unleſſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion bee a rigid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A practice not ſuitable to the Goſpel of grace and love, but to policy and ſenſuality, not comming from above, but from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, whether it tends, and is therefore to be ſhund and abhord of all men.</note> 
               <hi>blind and prepoſterous zeal in ſeeking dominion over the faith of our brethren and fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and by humane and poſitive lawes inhumanely,</hi> (Rev. 13.15, 16, 17.) <hi>to compell their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and conſciences to conformity to our dictates and determinations in matters of the worſhip of</hi> God.) We have much hearing much pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much talking amongſt men, but little love, whereas all the means that God uſeth with us, is to manifeſt his love to us, that ſo we may love him, and one another. To do good, and to ſhew mercy, are ſervices well pleaſing to God, better then all burnt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings and Sacrifices, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22. hearing, praying and diſcourſing is no further bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, then it tends to edification in love; yea it is abomination if love be wanting. Pure Religion, and undefiled before God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:119925:90"/>and the father, is this, To viſite the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and the Widdowes in their affliction, and to keepe our ſelves unſpotted in the world; and who ſo hath this worlds goods, and ſeeth his brother hath need, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up his bowells of compaſsion, from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him, all his Religion is vaine, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>If any <hi>Object,</hi> that this doctrine of <hi>Gods</hi> rich and abundant grace to all, tends to looſeneſſe.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, (as formerly) that the grace of <hi>God</hi> which bringeth ſalvation to all men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, teacheth us to deny all ungodlines, and worldly luſts, and to live righteouſly and godlily in this preſent world, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12.] But if any abuſe this grace of God, and turne that into wantonneſſe, which naturally leads to holineſſe, the Judgment of <hi>God</hi> is juſt againſt thoſe that ſo doe: now I deſire you to conſider, what is here written in love, and that the love of <hi>God</hi> may be ſhed abroad in our hearts, that we may dwell in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119925:90"/>love, walke in love, and doe whatever wee doe in love; ſhall bee the prayer and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him who while hee lives never, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to remaine.</p>
